I have the proof, AND the receipts — I even won the Internet Efficiency Award for my budget saving Facebook Ad strategies!</p><p>If you're serious about being successful, and you have a computer or smart phone and an internet connection, you can jump in and start making money almost <em>immediately</em>. If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm interested, so what will I learn exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you’ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to CREATE FACEBOOK ADS THAT DELIVER REAL RESULTS. I’ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish.</em></p><p>You’ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalogue. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I’ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I’ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I’ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits.</p><p><em>Then</em> I’ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a WINNING FACEBOOK AD CAMPAIGN, so you can see what you need to do and WHY. I’ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select the right Ad to achieve your marketing goals</strong></p><p>You’ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We’ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook – Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people’s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, ENGAGING Ads.</p><p>Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people’s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I’ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel for ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I’ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set up your first Facebook Catalogue</strong></p><p>I’ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOGUE. Once you’ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalogue works by storing data you’ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalogue to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover the customer journey to purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find your IDEAL customer</strong></p><p>We’ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You’ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to HONE IN ON YOUR PERFECT CUSTOMER. I’ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I’ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You’ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you’re offering. You’ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you’ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>I’ll also be sharing POWERFUL INSIDER TARGETING STRATEGIES that will SUPERPOWER your custom and lookalike audience set up.</p><p>As well as this, we’ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting the most out of the Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they’re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and FAST.</p><p>I’ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you’ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer’s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events to take your Ad game to the next level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I’ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to GET MORE from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Facebook Ads Reporting and Attributions</strong></p><p>I’ll show you how to use Facebook Reporting to create interactive weekly email reports on all your Facebook Ad campaigns. This will help you see how all your Facebook Ads are performing and where your Ad spend is going.</p><p>This is invaluable information as you'll be able to funnel your ad spend to where it returns you the best investment. It also helps you identify weak areas, so you can see where you might be going wrong, and where you can improve.</p><p>You’ll also learn how to harness the power of Facebook Attributions, so you can use data driven tracking models to understand browser’s interaction with your ads, across multiple platforms.</p><p>Facebook attributions let you gain a greater insight into the customer journey to purchase. This is an awesome tool for any advertiser, as it enables you to measure the incremental impact of each of your ads in your customer’s path to conversion.</p><p><em>WAIT THAT'S NOT ALL…</em></p><p>You'll also be getting some amazing bonuses that will really help you to TAKE YOUR MARKETING GAME TO THE NEXT LEVEL.</p><p><strong>Convert more, sell FASTER</strong></p><p>You'll receive my EXCLUSIVE TECHNIQUES FOR MAXIMISING YOUR AD CONVERSION RATE ON FACEBOOK.</p><p>Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages. I'll be sharing what these are, and how you can easily implement them in my course.</p><p><strong>Create compelling AD COPY THAT SELLS</strong></p><p>You'll also get a comprehensive QUICK START GUIDE TO COPYWRITING MASTERY, so you can create copy that engages right off the bat. This guide was authored by a professional copywriter, who will share the essential secrets you need to know to get people to take the actions you want.</p><p>MAKE MANY MORE SALES and get more click throughs, reads, shares, and engagements, with this ultimate BONUS shortcut guide to Copywriting success.</p><p><strong>Why do you need this course?</strong></p><p>The digital marketplace is changing fast and there’s just so much competition out there.
