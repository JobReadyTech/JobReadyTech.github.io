In fact, one for every five people in Canada was born in a foreign land who arrived in the country as an immigrant. They presented roughly 20% of the country’s total population, making Canada more diverse than China. Having a life in Canada is one of the most wonderful experience a person can ever get. A nation with respect to human rights, equality and freedom among its citizen.</p><p>One must truly say that being Canadian means both privilege and opportunity. In fact, a permanent Canadian citizen can gain access to a lot of opportunities and benefits such as free healthcare and access to a publicly well-funded school.

One of the steps to become an official citizen is by taking up a Canadian Citizenship Test, it is administered by the Department of Immigration of which all immigrants and refugees who are applying for a citizenship is required to take. It grants citizenship for all those who will pass the exam and was meant to facilitate immigrants and refugees to settle permanently in Canada.</p><p><strong>The Cost of a Wonderful Living</strong></p><p>Now what are the requirements that you need to submit and present to obtain a Canadian citizenship?</p><ul><li><p>People aged over 18yrs. Old are eligible to take the exam</p></li><li><p>Must be able to speak and write any of Canada’s official languages (English and French)</p></li><li><p>Have been settling in Canada for 3 years out of the last 5 years before the day of application.</p></li><li><p>Have filed all taxes for at least 3 years during the last 5 years, note that all income taxes that you owe must be fully paid.</p></li></ul><p>Canadian Citizenship can only be obtained through a legal permanent residency in Canada or through the following.</p><p><strong>If the person is under 18 years of age,</strong> the guardian or the parent of the applicant will have to apply on behalf of them for a citizenship.</p><p><strong>If the person is over 18 years of age and have children,</strong> he/she can include application with your own.</p><p>Fast track citizenship application process is given to any member of the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces.</strong></p><p>Upon the day of the test, the applicant must present a letter of consent from the government informing the authorities on the actual day of your test, followed by an informal interview that can take up to 30 minutes and you will be asked to provide all the necessary documents for the citizenship test.</p><p>Each applicant must bring the following,</p><ul><li><p>Record of Landing (IMM 1000) or <em>Confirmation of Permanent Residence</em> (IMM 5292)</p></li><li><p>Permanent Resident Card (PRC).</p></li><li><p>One identity document which includes the applicant’s photograph with signature.</p></li><li><p>Passports and all travel documents that the applicant possess.</p></li><li><p>Original copies of all supporting documents such as <em>Birth Certificate, Marriage Contract etc.</em></p></li></ul><p>After submitting the requirements, it will now be verified through the following information,</p><ul><li><p>Signature of the applicant on the notice form is necessary.</p></li><li><p>The signature provided in the notice form will be verified by comparing it to the signatures in the applicant’s supporting documents.</p></li><li><p>Photos provided along with the supporting documents will be verified against the person in front of the official. This is the reason why your actual presence is really important.</p></li></ul><p>Take note, that applicants who fail to prove their identity will not be allowed to take the actual test. Citizenship officers will then check the original copies and will coordinate the authenticity of these documents to the corresponding consular offices.</p><p>Only those who completed the requirements will continue to take the exam, only certified copies or original copies of documents can be accepted as proof of application unless the applicant is currently applying for a replacement of certificate.</p><p>Now that the requirements are ready, time to schedule and pass the Canadian Citizenship Exam.</p><p><strong>The Test of Fate</strong></p><p>The test is based on a study guide by the government to determine the applicant’s knowledge in Canadian history, geography, culture and politics.</p><p>The citizenship exam lasts for 30 minutes with 20 multiple questions, applicants who are taking up the exam must answer at least 15 correct questions out of 20 to pass the exam.</p><p>Passing rate for the last 5 years is more than 60%, but rest assured that this test is not as easy as your history lessons. The exam is totally different, imagine for instance, an immigrant who have been a Filipino citizen for his entire life might face the most difficult written exam in his entire life. For the test focuses on a wide range of subject matters such as:</p><ul><li><p>Rights and Responsibilities of a Canadian Citizen</p></li><li><p>Canadian History</p></li><li><p>Canadian Political Systems</p></li><li><p>Canadian Physical and Political Geography</p></li></ul><p>Canadian roots and population will also be portrayed in the exam and the applicant must have an idea on how they value democracy, gender equality and human rights.</p><p>The exam is usually written, however in some cases, this test might be done in oral depending on the situation. The test is divided into different stages, from the history of the native people who first lived in Canada, the language that they use, their culture and the early form of their civilization. The first segment of the exam focuses more on the history of the first people in Canada and the language that they use although out the colonial period.</p><p>Taking up the exam means to study the entire history, demographics and geography of Canada. After finishing the first segment of the exam, it will be followed by a test on Modern Day Canada, Economy and Symbolism. This test shows you the actual scenario of what it means to become a real Canadian Citizen and embracing the history and rich culture of Canada.</p><p><strong>By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail.</strong></p><p>There different institutions and online practices that you can find to sharpen your deep knowledge about the Canadian history, culture, roots and politics. Prepare yourself and begin to ready your history books and take up online courses for the exam only allows you have 5 wrong answer, answer all the questions and if you do not know the answer, a 25% chance of guessing the right answer might help you out. Read much and study harder before the exam but make sure not to put too much pressure on it. Get some rest and a decent sleep before the day of examination. Relax, read and understand the questions.</p><p><strong>After Passing the Exam</strong></p><p>If the applicant met the requirements of having a minimum of 15 correct answers and when the official has done verifying the authenticity of the applicant’s documents. He/she will be invited to attend a citizenship ceremony within 4-6 months or might receive another questionnaire requesting more evidence of living in Canada.</p><p>After passing the exam, the citizenship authorities will provide the exact date and time of the citizenship ceremony, in the ceremony, the applicant will begin to take an Oath of Citizenship announcing that he is now legally and officially a Canadian citizen. After the Oathtaking, the applicant’s citizenship certificate will be given.</p><p>Try not to worry more about the residency questionnaire, for it will only ask the applicant to provide more evidence of his living in Canada. Usually this is given to those who have traveled a lot outside Canada or those who have complexity in the application. Once the applicant receives this residency questionnaire, he will be invited for an interview once again with the citizenship officer and might ask for more supportive documents.</p><p><strong>A hope for those who failed the Citizenship Test</strong></p><p>If the applicant failed to pass exam but meet all the requirements to become a Canadian citizen, the Citizenship Officer will recommend the applicant to retake the exam or reschedule a second test. This could happen within 4-8 weeks after the commencement of the first one. The applicant must confirm his attendance for the second exam to the authorities immediately. During the second exam, the applicant will also receive the results on the same day. If the applicant, once again failed the exam he will be invited by a citizenship judge for an interview that usually takes 30-90 minutes. You will be asked a lot of questions orally on why you need to become a Canadian citizen. The judge would want to know the motives of your application and might ask the legitimacy of the time that you spent living in Canada. This interview will also test your English or French language skills as well as your knowledge about Canada.</p></body></html>
