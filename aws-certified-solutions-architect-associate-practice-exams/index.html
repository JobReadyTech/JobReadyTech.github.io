Our students love these high-quality practice tests because they simulate the actual certification exam and help them understand the AWS concepts. Check out the reviews confirming that our AWS practice questions closely match the exam pattern and difficulty. Our practice tests will prepare you thoroughly for the real exam so that you get to pass first time with confidence. </p><p><em>Watch the intro video to learn how these Practice Exams will fast-track your exam success!</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>SPECIAL&nbsp;BONUS&nbsp;OFFER:&nbsp;</strong>Exclusive Access to the Online Exam Simulator from Digital Cloud Training with 500+&nbsp;Practice Questions</p><p>We are now offering <strong>FREE 12-month access to the Exam Simulator</strong> on the Digital Cloud Training website (optional, registration required with name and email). The exam simulator randomly selects 65 questions from our pool of over <strong>500 unique questions</strong> - mimicking the real AWS exam environment. The practice exam has the same format, style, time limit and passing score as the real AWS&nbsp;exam. Simply the best way to assess your exam readiness. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>TOP REASONS WHY THESE PRACTICE EXAMS ARE YOUR BEST CHANCE TO ACE YOUR AWS EXAM </strong></p><p><strong>100% CONFORM WITH SAA-C02 EXAM BLUEPRINT</strong>: Practice Tests on Udemy are 100% scenario-based reflecting the latest AWS exam question/answer format (1 answer from 4 options, or 2 or more answers from 5 or more options)</p><p><strong>SIMULATE THE ACTUAL CERTIFICATION EXAM</strong>: Practice Tests are timed (130 min to answer 65 questions) and scored (passing score is 72%) mimicking the real exam environment so you get familiar with the AWS exam format</p><p><strong>DEEP DIVE REFERENCE LINKS</strong>:&nbsp; To help you understand the concepts, all answers link to relevant sections of our online "Training Notes" - the most comprehensive collection of exam-specific information for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam</p><p><strong>DETAILED EXPLANATIONS FOR ALL ANSWERS</strong>: After completing the practice test, you get to review and check your answers. Every question includes a detailed explanation that explains why each answer is correct or incorrect, supporting your understanding of AWS Services which is key to passing the exam</p><p><strong>WEEKLY UPDATES OF QUESTION BANK</strong>: We're constantly improving and updating the questions based on exam feedback from thousands of our students. Because of our tested and proven approach, most of our students achieve amazing results with an average exam score of over 85%</p><p><strong>TEST REPORT</strong>: Upon completion of the Practice Test you are presented with a report. This allows you to track your progress and highlights the AWS knowledge areas you need to focus on most in your studies</p><p><strong>RESPONSIVE SUPPORT</strong>: Our team of AWS experts comprehensively respond to all of your questions, concerns or feedback</p><p><strong>ACTIVE Q&amp;A DISCUSSION BOARD</strong>: Join the discussion on AWS related topics in our Q&amp;A discussion board where our students share their recent exam experience offering feedback on which topics were covered</p><p><strong>MOBILE ACCESS</strong>: Study on the go and access all practice questions from your mobile phone - anywhere, anytime</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT&nbsp;DO&nbsp;OTHER&nbsp;STUDENTS&nbsp;SAY?</strong></p><p>Our practice tests are widely considered to be the best as they prepare you to the point where you will confidently pass your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam with a great score. But don't take my word for it, check out the <strong>excellent course reviews </strong>from our happy students who passed their AWS exam with an average passing score of over 850!</p><p><em>"Well Crafted Questionnaire material, which will help you to gain the confidence on taking the exam. I greatly recommend anyone to take this practice text before appearing for the exam."</em></p><p><em>"Just passed the exam with a surprisingly good score and found that these practice exams were very helpful. I tried some other courses too but these questions were most similar to the AWS exam and the free theory notes on the website were invaluable."</em></p><p><em>"I've never worked in architecture before and had very little experience in AWS. However, I was able to pass the CSAA exam with 92%, and I have to say that most of the credit goes to these practice exams. If you only buy one practice course, make it this one. I can't recommend it enough."</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>HOW TO BEST PREPARE FOR YOUR AWS CERTIFICATION EXAM</strong></p><p><strong>KEY TRAINING ADVICE</strong>: Although the actual AWS&nbsp;exam has a pass mark of 72%, we recommend that you repeatedly retake our AWS practice exams until you consistently score 80% or higher. We encourage you to put in the work and study the training notes in detail! Once you achieve the recommended score in the practice tests - you are ready to sit the exam and achieve a great score!</p><p><strong>COVERING AWS FUNDAMENTALS</strong>: Through our AWS practice exams and AWS Training Notes, we cover the fundamentals of AWS Architecture and how to create performant, cost-optimized, and fault-tolerant applications. We also deep dive into individual services including Amazon S3, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Storage Gateway, Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, AWS IAM, AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS, Route 53, DynamoDB, RedShift, ElastiCache, Amazon Aurora, VPC, SQS, SNS, SWF, ElasticTranscoder, Amazon Kinesis, API Gateway, Direct Connect, Snowball, CloudWatch, CloudTrail and many more.</p><p><strong>UNDERSTANDING AWS ARCHITECTURE</strong>: The AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam is composed entirely of scenario-based questions that test your knowledge and experience working with Amazon Web Services. The key to success is to know in which situation you would use a specific AWS service, and what the cost, operational, security and performance implications are of different design choices. Understanding AWS Architecture choices comes through experience but our AWS practice exams are designed to help even beginners to answer these questions.</p><p><strong>CONFORM WITH EXAM BLUEPRINT</strong>: Using our AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate practice exams can help to gain experience with the test question format and how the questions in the real AWS exam are structured. Unfortunately, there are many AWS practice tests in the market that do NOT match the format of the exam pattern. Rest assured that with our practice tests you will be adequately prepared for the real AWS exam. </p><p><strong>DEEPEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE</strong>: Please note that though we match the AWS exam pattern, our AWS practice exams are not brain dumps. Please don’t expect to pass the real AWS certification exam by simply memorizing answers. Instead, we encourage you to use our AWS Solutions Architect practice exams to deepen your knowledge. This is your best chance to successfully pass your exam no matter what questions you are presented with in your real exam.</p><p><strong>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</strong>: AWS Training and AWS Certification is required in most IT job roles today. In fact, Amazon Web Services is the premier provider of cloud computing services. Our AWS Practice Tests and supporting AWS certification training resources have been created to help you to gain a competitive advantage and ensure that you pass your AWS Certified Solutions Architect certification exam with confidence. </p><p><br></p><p><strong>KEY FEATURES OF THESE&nbsp;POPULAR&nbsp;PRACTICE EXAMS</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>500+ PRACTICE&nbsp;QUESTIONS:</strong> 6 sets of Practice Exams (with 65 Questions each) available on Udemy and access to the online Exam Simulator from Digital Cloud Training with a pool of 500+ questions to assess your exam readiness</p></li><li><p><strong>EXAM SIMULATION</strong>: All Practice Tests are timed and scored (passing score is 72%) mimicking the real exam environment</p></li><li><p><strong>DETAILED EXPLANATIONS</strong>: Every question includes a detailed explanation that explains why each answer is correct or incorrect</p></li><li><p><strong>REFERENCE LINKS</strong>: To help you understand the AWS concepts, all answers link to relevant sections of our online Training Notes (Cheat Sheets) with exam-specific information</p></li><li><p><strong>RANDOMIZED QUESTIONS</strong>: Each time you take the test, the questions and answers are randomized, making it more challenging to ensure you're learning and not memorizing</p></li><li><p><strong>PREMIUM-QUALITY:</strong> These practice questions are free from typos and technical errors which makes your learning experience much more pleasant</p></li><li><p><strong>ALWAYS&nbsp;UP&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DATE</strong>: Our question bank is constantly updated based on student feedback from the real exam.
