If you have the chance to participate in offline art therapy, this should always be your priority.</p><p>My <strong>The Complete Art Therapy Course for Self Healing</strong> course "Personal Development and Self Healing through Art (Beginner) " shows you how to use art as expressive tool at home. It also introduces Art Therapy to you and hopefully inspires you to look up a professional art therapist in your area to take part in a live session.</p><p><em>Keywords: art therapy, arts therapy, creative art therapy, kunsttherapie, self healing, mandala, self care, self portrait, art journal, zebra soul art, 30 art therapy exercises, art exploration,art.
