People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news.</description>

It is merely a set of activities that anyone can do in an attempt to control and reduce the use and abuse of time spent on a smartphone. The average time spent online is around 7 hours per day, and most of it is done via a smartphone.</description>

But few know how to identify and separate them, so often they rule our life. Learn how to identify your irrational thinking patterns and make them more rational, through rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT).</description>

      <description>Uncover the secrets to creating extremely successful marketing campaigns on Snapchat!

Although the specifics of each decision differ, the concept of relevant costs helps us put together a process for gathering and analyzing data, picking up the information that matters, and removing all the excess data that does not matter to our decision.</description>

      <description>The Role of Electricity in the automobile in the past, electrical systems was basically stand-alone. For example, the ignition system was only responsible for supplying the voltage needed to fire the spark plugs. Ignition timing was controlled by vacuum and mechanical advance systems. Today there are very few electrical systems that are still independent. Today, most manufacturers network their electrical systems together through computers. This means that information gathered by one system can be used by another.</description>

      <description>The biggest problem with Facebook in recent years is that their organic reach—the people you can reach without spending money—has declined to nearly zero.
Most people are fans of dozens, if not hundreds of pages on Facebook. If all those pages shared several articles per day, most of the posts would just get lost, anyway. There’s just too much content being posted.
So, Facebook has implemented some changes that make it so that only a small fraction of a page’s users ever see each post.</description>

Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything.

Por supuesto, esas sociedades no tenían presentaciones de diapositivas, pero sí tenían la necesidad de hablar en público. Por ello, desarrollaron métodos para hacerlo que todavía se estudian hoy en día.</description>

      <description>What is sql injection?
A SQL injection is an attack in which the attacker sends a specially crafted SQL query (statement), to a database server and modifies the database as desired. An SQL injection occurs when user input is improperly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
The vulnerability can be exploited by providing input via the user interface, or through hidden fields; however, if user input is used for parameters such as a name or an id, those parameters should be validated as well to make sure that no invalid input is used.</description>

      <guid>https://jobready.courseintern.com/orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing-ofdm/</guid>
      <description>Due to its numerous advantages, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been the most dominantly used transmission waveform in the vast majority of the currently available standards, such as WiFi, WiMax, DVB, LTE, and NB-IoT. Moreover, it should not be a surprise that the OFDM waveform (with its new parametrized waveforms to meet the diverse requirements of different emerging applications and services) has successfully maintained its dominance in 5G systems. It has been adopted due to its desirable properties and features, including higher spectral efficiency, robustness to multipath with simple equalization in the frequency domain, easy integration with MIMO systems, and multi-user diversity where time and frequency resources are flexibly scheduled among users based on their requirements and channel conditions.</description>

      <description>Cars, trucks, buses, and off-road vehicles are all considered mobile sources of air pollution. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons are released when fuel burns in an internal combustion engine. They may also be released when vehicle tailpipes emit air and fuel residuals. Gasoline vapors also escape into the atmosphere during refueling and when fuel vaporizes from engines and fuel systems caused by vehicle operation or hot weather.
The pollutants in engine emissions from vehicles and lawn equipment cause damage to lung tissue and can lead to and aggravate respiratory diseases, such as asthma.</description>

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5 Star rating- July 2018
Yes, it&#39;s excellent… Very good overview of - and training in - the DIRECT SELLING industry.
Having been in this industry for over 32 years (part time, in addition to my Business &amp;amp; Financial Consulting practice) - and having had the privilege of serving on the Board Of Directors of the industry&#39;s professional association for 4 years, representing Canada (ANMP[dot]com - the Association of Network Marketing Professionals) - I see this eCourse from IDSEI, and the accompanying CNM designation, as an important step - both in preparing Affiliates for their business success - and in raising the bar within the industry.</description>

Boundaries are sometimes disregarded, we all experience boundary pushers. Most of the time, people are not trying to push our limits. Most of the time, these violations occur because we haven’t voiced what our needs are or what our wants are.</description>

No matter how many times I attempted to understand &#39;would&#39; either by looking up the dictionaries or the grammar books, none of them made any difference and I ended up not to understand it. Curious thing is that I came across would quite often and it was literally driving me crazy because I was not able to discover the hidden secret behind it.</description>

Aristotle answers. “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom”. Gaining mastery over others could be perceived to be a strength. But gaining mastery over yourself is true power. People who have realized this simple but profound fact have gone on to achieve great things in life.</description>

      <description>As a computer science teacher, I noticed that IP addressing was one of the most intimidating topics for my students, and yet, it&#39;s so simple for those who truly get to understand it.
My goal here was to create a course that is as simple as possible, and therefore, easy to understand for everyone, including those who are just beginning their journey into computer networks. One thing I added (that I haven&#39;t seen in the other courses) is summarization - this topic may not be interesting to beginners, but if you plan on getting familiar with advanced routing techniques, you may want to practice summarization.</description>

      <description>What is the final aim of marketing on social media or anywhere at all, yes you guessed it right, the answer is to get actual paying customers or clients. social media marketing, email marketing, and digital marketing, etc are all to make revenues for our brands and businesses and the most common way to do that is sales of products and services.
After successfully helping several businesses and brands market on social media, we discovered that one of the biggest issues faced by businesses is actually getting new clients and customers to trust their business and pay for their products and services which was basically the whole aim of the marketing, this issue was more prominent in medium and small scale businesses especially the new ones, because lets face it, the internet is not really a 100% safe place is it?</description>

転職やフリーランス、Webシステム構築で安定した豊かな生活を手にしたいと思ったことはありませんか？
ここ最近では、コロナによるリモートワークの普及で、システム開発をリモートで行う需要が増えており、特にAWSを使ってのシステム開発は今後も増えていきます。コロナが今後落ち着くかもしれませんが、将来的にまた別の原因によって会社でのシステム開発ができなくなるかもしれません。
もし、そうなった場合にAWSでの開発経験があれば、柔軟に対応できますし、転職やフリーランスなどにも有利になります。この講座で、AWSでのシステム開発を実際に行うことで、AWSでのシステム開発の仕組みを理解することが可能になります。
また、WixでAPI連携を使うことでHTMLとCSSでのコーディングのデザインをする必要がなくなり、画面を直感的に作成できるので、開発時間を大幅に短縮できます。これは個人でシステム開発をしてサービスをリリースする方にとって大きなメリットになると思います。自分でWebシステムを構築してサービスを提供してすることで、さらに安定した生活を手にできます。是非ともWixとAWSでのAPIシステム開発を覚えることで将来に備えていただければと思います。
また本講座はAWSを覚えてリモートワークしたい人の就活・転職用ポートフォリオ作品の超速作成術としてもご活用できますので、是非ご活用いただければと思います。
それでは、このコースの中でお会いしましょう。

Good architects are often people who learn from even better architects. Perhaps this is because some conceptual requirements are inherent in almost all projects. Each conceptual requirement is formulated as a question that the architect must ask himself during the project.</description>

      <description>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain’s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy.</description>

      <description>Greetings, Friend
Do you wish you could spend less time working on your company and more time working in it?
I understand that this sounds challenging at this point because you&#39;re used to having everything under control.
Control, on the other hand, does not always imply that you must do everything yourself.
In truth, a simple program called &#34;Zapier&#34; can automate a lot of the operations you undertake online.
Have you heard of it before?</description>

Its size must not be mistaken for its potency - small in size yet packs a very big punch. Although the book mirrors much of the content in 2 Peter it provides many unique features of its own.</description>

      <description>How To Win: If there was a Book in the Bible that illustrates how a Christian should live in an overtly worldly setting, then 1 Corinthians speaks volumes and offers numerous tactics to help us navigate such terrain.
After starting the Church (Acts 18) the people continued many of their worldly practices alongside their Christian walk. There was division, selfishness, promiscuity, immorality on one side, and extreme living - abstinence from marriage, food, etc on the other side of the spectrum.</description>

Did you know that fruit juices are the cleansers of the human system … and vegetable juices are the builders that revitalize the body?
No one doubts that eating vegetables are good for you. But the problem with vegetables are ... They’re so boring! Nothing is more boring than chewing on a carrot for what seems like hours.
Plus, if you’re like me, then you know that vegetables like kale, ginger, and brussel sprouts are good for you, but you just can’t stand the taste.</description>

Born to Visvanatha Iyer and Vengalakshmi in a Tamil Brahmin family at Tiruvarur on April 26, 1762, Venkata Subrahmanya popularly known as Shyama Shastri was the eldest of the three jewels of Carnatic music - the distinguished trio of composer-musicians of Carnatic music including Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri himself.</description>

      <description>Journaling is a powerful mindfulness tool that helps us self-reflect and catch various streams of thoughts and emotions. When we write things down, we literally transfer our thoughts out of our minds on paper. Our opinions are shaped, we untangle messy strings of ideas in our mind and create a logical flow of things with each sentence. As a result, we gain clarity on what we think and how we really feel.</description>

      <description>CRISPR/Cas9 is a gene-editing tool that can manipulate gene expression in plants, humans, and animals. CRISPR, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, are short sections of bacterial DNA containing repetitive base sequences. CRISPR plays a crucial role in the immune response of bacteria against foreign DNA. When a bacterium detects viral DNA, it produces two strands of short RNA called guide RNA, which then go on to form a complex with an endonuclease enzyme called Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9).</description>

&#34;Die Bilanz muss immer aufgehen&#34; - Der klassische Spruch aus der Finanzabteilung bzw. Rechnungswesen.
Es ist schon relativ herausfordernd, die klassischen Kennzahlen einer Bilanz zu lesen, zu verstehen und zu interpretieren. Dabei passiert es oft, dass mehrere Excel-Dateien verwendet werden und immer wieder mit kopieren und einfügen die Daten regelrecht zu &#34;sammeln&#34;.
Das muss nicht sein. Sie können wunderbar nur 1 Excel-Datei für Ihre Bilanzanalyse verwenden inkl. Cashflow, GuV, ROI und der dazugehörigen Kennzahlen-Analyse.</description>

      <description>Meaning can be altered when listeners don&#39;t understand your vowels. Changing one vowel slightly can completely change the meaning of a word. Not spending enough time on one vowel can also change the meaning! Learn how to correct the American English vowel pronunciation errors that native Chinese speakers frequently make. The instructor uses a vowel chart to demonstrate the similarities and differences between all the vowels. Then she describes and shows exactly how to produce each vowel and puts the vowels in example sentences that use advanced vocabulary from professional settings, such as high tech and business.</description>

&#34;Heal from The Narcissist with Ho&#39;oponopono&#34;
Learning The Ho&#39;oponopono Prayer/mantra will not only re-program negative subconscious triggers but will also re-wire the subconscious to before The Narcissist got hold of you.
The Narcissist secretly works with your &#34;Inner child&#34; and your &#34;Inner critic&#34; adding more cognitive damage to your development, leaving you stuck in illusion and confusion (for years)
Ho&#39;oponopono helps you rewire your subconscious programming to 0 (When you were born) before your belief system and subconscious were conditioned.</description>

      <description>This Pauline letter was written to address the verbal plague that was spreading through the Church. It advocated that what Jesus did on the cross was not good enough without circumcision. Hence Paul&#39;s responses were stern and yet with an unusual depth of Old Testament revelations. As an example, Paul used the story of Ishmael mocking Isaac in the book of Genesis (21v9) to explain the manner the Jewish believers were persecuting the gentile believers at that time.</description>

In This course I don&#39;t just show you the way but i built a new dropshipping business while you can see all the process how I picked the product, build the site, market it to start making over 1400$ a day with 400$ net profit, all of this is in under 14 days time frame, if you don&#39;t scale this result and you just keep the same income that&#39;s half a million dollar a year business with over 100k net profit, But the potential of this business is to make a way more money and I think that&#39;s more than enough amount to make you leave your 9 to 5 because I live in the most expansive state in USA and that&#39;s more than enough to have a comfortable living.</description>

      <description>Most people have considered working on a side hustle in order to make more money each month, or perhaps save for retirement.
But unfortunately, many of those same people never took action because they weren&#39;t sure how to work on a side hustle while working on other projects, or perhaps they&#39;re still in a 9-5.
The issue is, there&#39;s a lot of confusion about what a side hustle really means. Many blogs and websites that provide information about side hustles highlight them as though they are a main source of income - and in truth they can turn into that - but that isn&#39;t necessary.</description>

      <description>If you have never imagined what living life on autopilot is, this may be because you are going all autopilot and not realizing it. Being conscious about our lives is the least we can do to actually live the better life.
So, what does neuroplasticity have to do with it? Pretty easy. Neuroplasticity helps our brain to get out of the ‘comfort zone’, of sorts. It helps us learn new things, thus expanding our brain broad and wide for everything new the world can offer.</description>

      <description>Elektroerozyon (EDM), iş parçasına istenilen şekli vermek için elektrik boşalmasından faydalanılan üretim yöntemidir. Elektrik iletkeni malzemelere uygulananır. Metal aşındırma işlemi takım görevini yapan bir elektrot ile iş parçası arasında meydana gelen kıvılcımların yardımıyla gerçekleştirilir. Kıvılcımlar, ergime ve buharlaşma yoluyla çok küçük malzeme parçacıkları kaldırarak parça yüzeyini erozyona tabi tutar ve parça üzerinde ufak çukurlar oluşturur. EDM sırasında elektrot ile iş parçası arasındaki mesafe 0,0125 mm ile 0,05 mm arasındadır. Bu mesafe takım ve iş parçası arasında elektrik arkı oluşması için yeterlidir.</description>

      <description>Hidrolik pistonlar, üzerindeki sıvı basıncını, silindir şeklindeki piston mekanizması sayesinde hareket enerjisine dönüştürebilen, yani uygulanan basınçla mekanik enerji üretebilen sistemlerdir. Hidrolik pompalar tarafından üretilen enerji çeşitli silindirler yardımıyla doğrusal veya açısal harekete dönüşmektedir. Buradaki açığa çıkan kuvvetin büyüklüğünü belirleyen en önemli faktörler, silindirin çapı ve çeşididir.
Hidrolik silindir gövde ve piston olarak iki ana parçadan meydana gelir. Bunların yanında sızdırmazlık elemanları ve bağlantı elemanları silindir üzerinde bulunmaktadır. Çok yüksek basınçlarda kullanıldığı için gömlek et kalınlığı kaldırabileceği basınca göre hesaplanır.</description>

To ensure they remained in faith because he was unable to visit them, therefore, he had to send Timothy. He also wrote the letter to the Thessalonians to encourage them in faith so that they will not be unsettled by Paul’s trials (1 Thessalonians 2v17-3v3). He also wrote the letter to silence those who felt he took advantage of the people of Thessalonica.</description>

      <description>Understanding CMD
With the command shell, you can have direct interaction with the operating system. Think command prompt as an interpreter that accepts the commands or the User’s inputs and translate them into machine language. These commands are predefined and perform a specific task. These commands can be clubbed together as well to perform a series of task. Also, these commands need not be entered manually and can be written in a batch file to automate some of the manual tasks like taking a scheduled server backup, deleting junk files and so on.</description>

The Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic. The text fell into obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and began to regain popularity in late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda, the Theosophical Society and others.</description>

I&#39;ve shown the steps to make money online to 100,000&#39;s of people.
But even though many people know how to make money, very few of them actually take action.
It&#39;s not because they wouldn&#39;t know what to do but because they are AFRAID!
Most people don&#39;t have the right mindset and that&#39;s why they don&#39;t start even though they know step-by-step how to make money.</description>

      <description>ТАБС (от слияния английских слов Tabata и Abs) - это уникальная серия обучающих высоко интенсивных интервальных видео-тренировок построенных по типу Табата с акцентом на талию и пресс. Такой тип тренировок более эффективен, по сравнению с обычными тренировками, так как процесс жиросжигания происходит не только во время тренировки, но и продолжается после тренировки. Курс состоит из 3х полноценных домашних тренировок по 30 минут, включающих в себя и разминку и отдых между подходами и заминку после тренировки, так что вам не нужно ничего дополнительно придумывать.</description>

      <description>Google Colaboratory is a Google cloud-based service that replicates Jupyter Notebook in the cloud. You don’t have to install anything on your system to use it.

You&#39;ll learn about the all features of Google Colaboratory.
The course is for you if you&#39;re a newcomer to Data Science and Python programming.</description>

Descripción del Curso:
Los edificios tienen una vulnerabilidad propia que resulta más o menos importante, pero inevitable. Las deficiencias inherentes a las técnicas y los materiales utilizados en su ejecución, por un lado, y el uso funcional de los mismos a lo largo de su vida útil, por otro, hace que vayan sufriendo un implacable deterioro que obliga a alguna intervención en un momento determinado de su vida, a pesar, incluso, de un adecuado mantenimiento.</description>

      <description>This isn&#39;t a managing program, it&#39;s psychology. It&#39;s about YOU. Your thoughts, blocks, obstacles, stressors, and how they affect you and the people you care for. Within every craft there is always a mental side of performance, and leadership is not different.
There are many ways stress can be viewed in our normal day-to-day struggle, but I’ll do my best to try not to treat it like a superficial topic, and while I wrote this with the intention of it being clear and practical, this is not a how-to guide or a tutorial on deep breathing.</description>

      <description>أهلا بكم في الفيديو التعليمي لرسم رسم شجرة بدون أوراق بألوان الخشب. حرصت في هذا الفيديو أن تبدأ من المستوي صفر وذلك لما يحتويه الفيديو من شقين، الأول هو رسم الشجرة حيث انها من الأشياء الهامة جدا في خيال كل رسام وفنان وثانيا وهي طريقة التعامل مع ألوان الخشب، لاظهار امكانياتها وقدرتها على التعبير بجرأة لرسم الأشجار
كان هدفي بهذه الدورة الاحساس بالمتعة في التعامل مع ألوان الخشب, وذلك بناء علي تكنيك مبسط وسهل, ولهذا قمت برسم للهيكل الأساسي (الساق والاغصان الكبيرة) للشجرة، ثم الأغصان الصغيرة لها, ثم التفاصيل الخاصة الصغيرة حتي تصل الي رسمها باحتراف, مع الأخذ في الاعتبار تأثير الإضاءة على رسم عناصر الشجرة من مناطق مضاءة واخري مظللة, مع ذكر الأخطاء الشائعة اثناء عملية الرسم.</description>

      <description>CLIENT MANAGEMENT IS CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Client management is not an easy position. In fact, any relationship management position is tough.
Namely, because clients are frequently angry or disappointed at your company.
And whose job is it to fix the mess? Yours.
Not to mention that you have to both make the company AND the client satisfied.
All in all, it&#39;s not a very easy position.
What most professionals underestimate, however, is the role of conflict management in client management.</description>

      <description>It is important for you as a network engineer to learn Linux!
Why? There are many reasons including:
1) A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. I&#39;ll show you an example using Cisco, Arista and Cumulus Linux.
2) Network Automation tools such as Ansible don&#39;t run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools.</description>

      <description>Alışkanlık, otomatikleşecek kadar çok tekrarlanmış davranıştır. Davranışlar duygulara, duygular ise kimliğinize bağlıdır. Altıncı his diye de ifade edebileceğimiz otomatik alışkanlıkları yaparken farketmeyiz bile. İçgüdülerimiz tarafından yönetildiğini düşündüğümüz bu alışkanlıklar aslında beynimizin ve vücudumuzun hiç düşünmediği alışkanlıklardır. İyi alışkanlıkları güçlendirerek, bunun duygu ve düşüncelerinize katkısını görebilirsiniz. Küçük değişimler ile büyük farklar yaratılabilir.
Alışkanlıkların nasıl oluştuğunu öğrenmek değiştirmek ve geliştirmek için önemlidir. 21 günde yapılan alışkanlık olur dense de konu bu kadar basite indirgenemez.</description>

      <description>Ich erinnere mich ungern an die Zeit, als ich kaum Affiliates bei Digistore24 hatte.
Damals habe ich verzweifelt versucht, endlich eine zuverlässige &#34;Affiliate-Armee&#34; aufzubauen, um dauerhaft mehr Umsatz zu machen.
Allerdings gab es ein Problem, denn Affiliates können sich nie 100%ig sicher sein, ob das Tracking funktioniert.
Das hat auch mich immer mehr frustriert, denn ich konnte ihnen keine klare Antwort geben.
Am schlimmsten wurde es, als ich tatsächlich nachgewiesen habe, dass das Standard-Tracking nicht richtig funktioniert und deswegen die Affiliates abspringen.</description>

      <description>Computer security is one of the biggest job gaps in history, with a shortage of 3.5 million skilled workers needing to tackle a problem estimated to be worth $6 trillion. This is one of the biggest opportunities in history.
When I was at university I did a lot of security courses and to be honest I was pretty frustrated at how they were taught. The concepts and their importance captured my imagination but I knew it could be taught in a better way.</description>

      <description>Ciao! In questo corso ti spiegherò come poter approcciare, nel migliore dei modi, alla composizione di un’ ottima sequenza dialogica e all’importanza che essa assume all’interno di un racconto, un romanzo o qualsivoglia opera di carattere narrativo. Considera che tra i motivi del “Blocco della pagina bianca&#34; di molti scrittori alle prime armi vi è proprio il senso di inadeguatezza o incapacità nell’affrontare la scrittura dei dialoghi e ti renderai conto che ovviare eliminando gli stessi dialoghi non rappresenta affatto una soluzione effettiva.</description>

      <description>Kamu Yönetimi dersleri, diğer bilim dalları ve derslerden farklı özellikler göstermektedir. Örneğin ülkelerin yapısı ve hiyerarşisine göre değişkenlik göstermesi sebebiyle uygulanış açıklama ve yorumları, evrensel bir dille genel bir yapı göstermediği için diğer dillerden bir uyarlama yapılamayıp, özgün çalışmalar gerektirir.
Bu kurs, bu sebeple daha önce yapılmış çalışmaların ışığında ve öğrencilerin sık karşılaştıkları veya karşılaşmak durumunda olacakları sorulara ve cevaplara çok fazla yer vererek, gerekli anlaşılır açıklamaların yapıldığı derslerden oluşmaktadır.</description>

      <description>Önemli Not : Bu kurs Türkiye&#39;nin ve Udemy&#39;nin ilk Oracle PL/SQL Programlama kursudur. 2011 yılında çekildi ve halen daha bu kadar kapsamlı başka bir Oracle kursu bulunmamaktadır. SQL ve PL/SQL dil özellikleri bilinenin aksine çok hızlı değişmez ve onlarca yıldır sektörde kullanılan bu dillerin özellikleri yok olmaz. Yeni Oracle versiyonlarında genellikle sadece yeni özellikler gelir(kullanıcı arayüzlerine ve dil özelliklerine). Yani bu kurs ilk ama halen günceldir. Bu kurs içerikleriyle hızlı şekilde dil ve genel mantığa hakim olduktan sonra zaman içinde gelen yeni özellikler için ayrıca güncel kitap ya da kurslar(kaliteli TR içerik yok, sadece İngilizce bulabilirsiniz) ile kendinizi daha da geliştirebilirsiniz.</description>

      <description>Veritabanı teknolojileri, sektörel olarak farklı birçok sorunu çözmek için hazırlanmış birçok farklı marka ve girişime sahiptir. Bu kadar çeşit olmasının nedeni iş ve teknoloji dünyasında veri ile ilgili çözülmesi gereken sorunların çeşitlilik göstermesidir. Klasik veri depolama gibi ihtiyaçları çözmek için, onlarca yıldır Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL vb. gibi gelişmiş VTYS&#39;ler kullanılmaya devam ediliyor. Ancak günümüz teknolojilerinin çok daha karmaşık ihtiyaçlara sahip olması nedeniyle bu veritabanı teknolojileri artık yeterli değildir. Bu nedenle NoSQL kategorisi altında MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra ve daha farklı onlarca alt veritabanı teknolojisi geliştirilmiştir.</description>

      <description>Breakups blow chunks. Whether it’s an amicable breakup or a horrible, crash-and-burn situation, you’ve invested a part of you into another person and must accept that a relationship that you once nurtured is dead and gone. Brain-mapping studies have shown that the same regions of the brain are activated when an addict is going through withdrawals as when someone is going through a breakup.
Whether the relationship lasted three weeks or three years, breakups can leave us feeling heartbroken, lost and even physically ill.</description>

      <description>Modern businesses are hiring for culture, not just skills. Having a spot-on resume and cover letter is necessary, but it’s only the one third of the battle. Who you are as a person is just as important to your next employer as what you can do for them.
Most of us have been taught a specific traditional method for job interviewing. Once we learn the traditional method, it can be hard to change our approach!</description>

      <description>(The course content has updated according to students&#39; interest on 16th August 2019)
‘Why did you leave your last job?’ ‘What are your weaknesses?’ ‘If you were a type of fruit, what would you be, and why?’
OK, so some interview questions are easier to answer than others. But whilst you can’t predict exactly what you’ll be asked, any question has the potential to make you stumble – unless, of course, you’ve prepared in advance.</description>

      <description>Creating the graphics is only one part of the job!
There is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that can eat into your design time - and PROFITS - if you don’t have your business model set up to protect you and create a transparent and open designer/client relationship at the same time.
Running a small business always has a fair share of the unexpected. Things happen outside the usual ‘get hired - do the design - get paid’ operations that can slow you down.</description>

      <description>What is ethical hacking?
Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.
Also known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture.</description>

Ongoing investigations have shown that individuals regret more the things they haven&#39;t done than the things they have done. Furthermore, sensations of disappointment and blame coming about because of botched freedoms will in general remain with individuals any longer.
Some of the time every one of our chances appear to be on our fingertips, however we can&#39;t contact them.</description>

      <description>Essere un Formatore Teatrale non è semplice, ci si ritrova ogni volta in contesti differenti, con persone di età diverse e che giungono con motivazioni più disparate. Per tali motivi ho cercato di non tralasciare alcun aspetto sul come impostare un Laboratorio Teatrale: dall&#39;organizzazione delle lezioni, alla tempistica, e poi tutti gli esercizi più importanti per fare un laboratorio teatrale, ognuno spiegato nei minimi particolari.
A dispetto di tanto impegno per fare un laboratorio di teatro, alla fine si hanno grandi soddisfazioni: si assiste lezione dopo lezione alla crescita degli aspiranti attori, li si vede affrontare i vari ostacoli e superarli, ed io stessa dopo ogni laboratorio mi sento arricchita, è qualcosa che solo chi ha sentito il profumo di un palco può capire.</description>

      <description>Cos&#39;è un&#39; improvvisazione? E se si chiama IMPROVVISAZIONE perché studiarla in un corso?
Perché sono state scritte tonnellate di libri a tal riguardo?
L&#39;improvvisazione è una vera e propria Arte e come tale necessita di studio, tecnica ed esperienza. Non si può improvvisare senza possedere le conoscenze adatte.
Esistono due differenti forme di improvvisazione, quella &#34;muta&#34; nella quale l&#39;unico strumento comunicativo è rappresentato dal corpo e quella &#34;parlata&#34; durante la quale voce(storytelling) e corpo agiscono all&#39;unisono, quest&#39;ultima è l&#39;improvvisazione di cui ti parlerò in questo corso.</description>

So I&amp;nbsp;have created this course to address that issue so that students will have their fundamentals down and will therefore be able to continually improve without limit.</description>

      <description>Now that we have worked our way through the basics of diatonic theory in our last course, that is to say, understanding major and minor scales and their harmonies, we’re ready to look at some styles that have strayed away from that system.
The most important influence on all the styles of popular music that break away from traditional European music, is Blues music- it doesn’t have to be your favorite thing to play or listen to, but whether you know it or not, there’s hardly a popular style in existence that doesn’t draw from it in some way or another.</description>

In this course I have therefore concentrated on core technologies, in other words how the technology works, rather than giving too many examples from specific vehicles. However, I have included some examples of Formula 1 technology, arguably the pinnacle of automotive engineering.</description>

      <description>Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern wie es war, meine ersten Online Produkte zu verkaufen.
Damals habe ich versucht, mit höherwertigen Kursen und Coachings Geld zu verdienen.
Allerdings hab ich damit gekämpft, ständig Rechnungen zu schreiben und den Überblick zu behalten.
So etwas frustriert und überfordert einen auf Dauer, und mir ging es genauso.
Dann ist etwas ziemlich Blödes passiert: Als ich mich nicht mehr um die Rechnungen (und auch Mahnungen) kümmern wollte, sind die Verkäufe natürlich eingebrochen.</description>

      <description>In general, fraud can be defined as some illegal or criminal thing done by any person who intended to deceive in financial organizations or personal profit. So the processes of analyzing such illegitimate transactions done by anyone like buyer or customer are caught and only the legal transactions are allowed to be made. As fraud is increasing in day to day life so to analyze frauds that are occurring in the organizations or companies these frauds are analyzed using some quantitative science to understand the fraud, through BI (Business Intelligence), and then we have to develop effective fraud detection solutions through data science.</description>
