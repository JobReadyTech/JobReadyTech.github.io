In this complete video guide, you’ll learn everything you need to know to get started building great links - the type that actually help to boost your SEO.</p><p>We’ll teach you the techniques you need to know to avoid getting penalised by Google, and what Google looks for when it ranks your link. You’ll learn why Site Relevance, Page Authority, and Domain Authority are important when it comes to the sites your links appear on and you’ll understand what makes up a link and how search engines interpret this.</p><p><strong>One of the most important things we’ll teach you is the right strategies to get more links - right now.</strong> You can’t just do the same old things you might have done a few years ago, link building has changed, and, in this guide, you’ll find the latest strategies to help you succeed with link building.</p><p>We’ve covered ALL the essentials, from the right way to approach guest blogging to how to perform successful link-building outreach, so you can get those all-important links on high authority relevant sites.</p><p>After watching this course, as long as you’re prepared to put in just a little effort, you’ll soon be able to acquire useful links that will give your search ranking a huge boost.</p><p><strong>We are confident you can succeed with link building, if you want to</strong> - and this guide will ensure you’ll have all the tools you need to form a link-building strategy that will help you achieve great results.</p><p><strong>What is Link Building?</strong></p><p><strong>The No 1 goal of link building is to boost your search engine visibility by getting links to your website on as many high-quality sites as possible.</strong> </p><p>There are numerous strategies you can use to achieve this, from the simple to the complex, including Content Marketing, Blogger Outreach, Resource Page linking, and PR.</p><p>Google used to use Page Rank to determine a page’s quality, which was partly based on how many people were linking to it. But when people found out how to game Page Rank, Google lost the ability to detect what was a good link and a bad one, which reduced their ranking algorithms effectiveness.</p><p>In 2012 Google made some crucial updates, to weed out shady black hat link building techniques and better determine quality links. They now place a lot of importance on link quality, as well as quantity, meaning where your link appears is just as crucial, if not more, as how many links you get.</p><p>Now Google regularly penalizes websites who use black hat techniques or over-optimise with low-quality link building. The value of certain techniques such as submitting your site to web directories has also fallen, due to being repeatedly overused.</p><p>Search engines use backlinks to find out about new web pages, which they then include in search results. They also use them to evaluate a page’s ranking position within search results.</p><p>Even though there have been a lot of changes, links are still critical if you want to rank well on Google. But employing low-quality link building techniques is not only a waste of your time and effort - but it could also actively damage your website’s ranking.</p><p>The bottom line is backlinks are still so vital to your visibility in search, they are Google’s key ranking signal. It’s <em>pivotal</em> to learn the most current white hat techniques that will help you acquire great backlinks, so keep watching as we show you what to avoid, and what to do in order to build high quality backlinks this year.</p><p><strong>What can Link Building do for you?</strong></p><p>Link building is important if you’re looking to build relationships with people in your industry for two primary reasons.</p><ol><li><p>It can help you acquire valuable backlinks on highly relevant, popular sites, but it also aids you in making connections over the long term. When you contact an influencer, site owner, or blogger with a well-written pitch that demonstrates the value of linking to you, you make that all-important first contact with someone who can be incredibly influential in your niche.</p></li><li><p>Even if they don’t say yes, the first time around, providing your pitch is polite and relevant, you’ll have made that all-important first contact. Next time, they might well say yes, or they might even come to you.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Get the RIGHT kind of traffic</strong></p><p>Links are incredibly useful for boosting your referral traffic and if you get a backlink on a popular website in your niche, you’ll likely see a significant increase in visitors. As the traffic will already be pre-screened for interest, if your link appears on a relevant site, rather than a more general one - it’s more likely to convert.</p><p>Getting your content, products, or services in front of people who are interested is a superb way to up the value of your links. Even if they don’t buy from you right away, you’ve raised your profile to an ideal target audience. This is something you should always be looking to do if your goal is to boost your SEO and expand your business.</p><p><strong>Establish your brand authority</strong></p><p>Your link building strategy can also help solidify your brand authority, particularly if you create content that’s relevant to what you offer, and valuable to potential customers.</p><p>If you have a sportswear e-commerce store for example and published a piece entitled <em>“Go from couch potato to 10K runner in 6 months”</em>, this would be extremely relevant to a significant portion of your audience.</p><p>There’s three ways you can benefit here.</p><ol><li><p>First, you’re attracting people to your brand, who’ve searched for the terms your piece has ranked for. Now they know who you are and are more likely to consider you an authority on a subject they are interested in.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, you’ll raise your site authority with Google if enough people link to your piece, which also helps to boost your search engine ranking.</p></li><li><p>Thirdly, you may make some sales, if you link smartly to your products in the piece, or at the end, or if you include offers placed well around your article.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What’s a hyperlink made of?</strong></p><p>To comprehend properly how links work and how search engines read them, you first need to understand all the different parts of a hyperlink - and what function they play.</p><p><strong>There are four main parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anchor tag</p></li><li><p>Href</p></li><li><p>Anchor text</p></li><li><p>Tag closure</p></li></ul><p>Let’s take a quick look at what these different parts do…</p><p><strong>Anchor tag </strong>- This is the part of your link that opens your link tag and lets search engines know a link is included.</p><p><strong>Href</strong> - Href is short for hyperlink referral and is the text inside the quote marks that shows where your URL is pointed to. It basically tells your browser where it needs to head to, whether that’s a web page, image, or a file.</p><p><strong>Anchor text</strong> - This is the visible text that people click on when they open your link. It’s often formatted differently from the rest of the text surrounding it, typically with an underline or blue colour to show it has been clickable.</p><p><strong>Tag closure</strong> - This one’s pretty straightforward, it’s the part of your link that lets the search engines know it’s now the end of your tag.</p><p><strong>How to get Links Google LOVES</strong></p><p>Your focus should be on acquiring links that will have a positive impact on your Google rank, and often the best kinds of links are the ones you never even asked for.</p><p>You get these types of links by consistently creating something of quality, whether that’s informative content, a unique website, or a really great product or service. When you do this regularly, people notice - and they naturally want to link to you.</p><p>Though you should <em>always </em>be trying to achieve these kinds of organic links, you shouldn’t sit around waiting for people to link to your site. Instead, actively help to raise more awareness of your brand and content by using a link building strategy that boosts your Google rankings.</p><p>While not all Google ranking factors are known, there are many which most experts agree have a definite impact on your search position. Start watching as we’re about to reveal the most important Google ranking factors you need to be aware of when it comes to link building.</p><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about backlinks and how to build them!</strong></p><p>Ing.
