      <description>Cryptocurrencies may feel confusing if you are a complete beginner... Not anymore!
I&#39;ll show you how cryptocurrency trading works in a SIMPLE &amp;amp; EASY way.
I&#39;ve educated over 350,000 people on Udemy and I&#39;d love to help you next.
After helping so many people, I&#39;ve realized that cryptocurrencies don&#39;t need to be complicated.
When you learn a few simple concepts, you&#39;re already ahead of 99.9% of the population. 1,000&#39;s of beginners have learned about Bitcoin &amp;amp; cryptocurrencies for the first time of their life through my Udemy &amp;amp; YouTube videos.</description>

      <description>This is a course that the Government doesn&#39;t want you to see! Bitcoin is the BEST-PERFORMING asset of the decade.
It&#39;s not a coincidence that Bitcoin has been growing over 200%/year on average!
Every smart person has already realized that Bitcoin is clearly superior compared to government money (=USD, EUR, PHP, INR, etc.)
That&#39;s why Bitcoin grows rapidly.
Smart people are trying to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before the rest of the population gets educated about the benefits of Bitcoin.</description>

I enjoyed learning about a different cryptocurrency than Bitcoin, but I would have liked more information on buying and selling Ripple. The instructor explained how to open accounts on two platforms. What is the difference between the two?</description>
