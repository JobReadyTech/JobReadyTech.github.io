      <description>This is a course that the Government doesn&#39;t want you to see! Bitcoin is the BEST-PERFORMING asset of the decade.
It&#39;s not a coincidence that Bitcoin has been growing over 200%/year on average!
Every smart person has already realized that Bitcoin is clearly superior compared to government money (=USD, EUR, PHP, INR, etc.)
That&#39;s why Bitcoin grows rapidly.
Smart people are trying to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before the rest of the population gets educated about the benefits of Bitcoin.</description>
