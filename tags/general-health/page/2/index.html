It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious.

This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult. ...
