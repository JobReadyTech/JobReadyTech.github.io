      <description>In order to read, write, speak and understand Arabic, it is important to learn the grammar. Arabic grammar can be tough and intimidating, but it doesn’t have to be. Grammar here means the important words that give structure to a sentence, in addition to the structures themselves. In linguistics, we call such words &#34;function words&#34;. When you know these words, you’ll be able to recognize them and use them easily to understand and build simple sentences.</description>
