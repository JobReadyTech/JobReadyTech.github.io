      <description>This course is designed for anyone who wants to lose fat, be healthy, and feel great.
My Weight Loss &amp;amp; Nutrition Course is not some random fad diet that tells you which foods you should and shouldn&#39;t eat. Instead, I will take you through each of the steps involved in setting up and following through with your diet.
Unfortunately, the internet is full of false health gurus that sell you all kinds of diet plans and supplements that are overpriced and don&#39;t work.</description>
