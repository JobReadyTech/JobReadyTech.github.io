      <description>はじめまして、講師のビビアンです。
本講座に興味を持っていただいてありがとうございます。
この案内を見ているあなたは以下の事で悩んでいるかもしれません。
「英検3級の二次試験をこれから取りたいけど、英語には自信はない」
「英語の面接に緊張してしまうから、どうしよう」
「今度こそ英検3級に合格して来年は2級を！」
もしこのようなことで悩んでいればこの講座はあなたに向いています。
英検3級の二次試験7日トレーニングでは
面接に落ちがちの理由を知って合格するための工夫ができる
試験の模擬試験を何度も繰り返すことで緊張がなくなる
ネイティブによる発音でリスニング力がグッーと上がる
しかも、講座が終わった後でも練習し続けて一遍に不安を消してしまいます。
第二次試験は5分間しかないですが、緊張や練習不足で落ちたりする人も少なくありません。
読み書きは上手ですが、スピーキングはちょっと。
そのためにできるだけ試験のフォーマットでスピーキングとリスニングが鍛えてもらえるように、7日間集中トレーニングの英検問題集を作りました！
私は中学生をメインに、英検のトレーニングをしてきました。
本当は知っているのに、緊張で間違えてしまうのはもったいない。
この講座では、模擬試験を繰り返して行い、解説を聞くことで、
質問を聴く能力が上がる、
パッセージを読むスピーキング力が上がる、
また英語っぽい英語を話すコツを身に着ける…
試験官に良い印象をつけてもらえる面接のテクニックを紹介していきます。
更に！
ボーナスとしてEnglish Onlyのオンラインテストをたくさん用意しています。
海外移住者が一日も早く英語の県境に慣れるために練習している本格的な英語を無料でアクセスしてこれから挑戦していく英検2級や1級のために実力を蓄えましょう。
この講座を受講すると、
英検3級2次試験の全体像を知り、緊張しないで面接に合格するコツを手に入れて、リアルの英語力を鍛えていけます。
そして、英検3級に合格してから使っていける練習資料を手にすることができます！
どんな感じの講座かなあと気になったら、
レッスンのプレビューを見てくださいね。
それでは、講座の中でお会いしましょう。
