      <description>Kamu Yönetimi dersleri, diğer bilim dalları ve derslerden farklı özellikler göstermektedir. Örneğin ülkelerin yapısı ve hiyerarşisine göre değişkenlik göstermesi sebebiyle uygulanış açıklama ve yorumları, evrensel bir dille genel bir yapı göstermediği için diğer dillerden bir uyarlama yapılamayıp, özgün çalışmalar gerektirir.
Bu kurs, bu sebeple daha önce yapılmış çalışmaların ışığında ve öğrencilerin sık karşılaştıkları veya karşılaşmak durumunda olacakları sorulara ve cevaplara çok fazla yer vererek, gerekli anlaşılır açıklamaların yapıldığı derslerden oluşmaktadır.</description>
