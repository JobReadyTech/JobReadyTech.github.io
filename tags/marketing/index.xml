Personal positioning is your own branding, it is simply what people think WHO you are. What we generally do is let people brand us… That is we let them judge what we are rather than telling them who we are… This is because we ourselves are scared and not sure about how we must portray ourselves… So, what we do is let them judge who we are?</description>

That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news.</description>

You need to be visible on the four major social media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Pinterest.</description>

      <guid>https://jobready.courseintern.com/social-media-mastery-increase-customer-conversion-rate/</guid>
      <description>What is the final aim of marketing on social media or anywhere at all, yes you guessed it right, the answer is to get actual paying customers or clients. social media marketing, email marketing, and digital marketing, etc are all to make revenues for our brands and businesses and the most common way to do that is sales of products and services.
After successfully helping several businesses and brands market on social media, we discovered that one of the biggest issues faced by businesses is actually getting new clients and customers to trust their business and pay for their products and services which was basically the whole aim of the marketing, this issue was more prominent in medium and small scale businesses especially the new ones, because lets face it, the internet is not really a 100% safe place is it?</description>
