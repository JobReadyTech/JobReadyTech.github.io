      <description>When you take this course, we will start you from an idea that you want to do YouTube video marketing and we will end with you crafting a professional YouTube channel as well as a strategy for how you will use it.&amp;nbsp;
Boomy and Lara are both internet marketing professionals committed to helping guide you with videos demonstrating the best and the worst in YouTube. We wanted this to be a course that you could watch while you work on your own channel, so it may take longer then the hour of video content.</description>
