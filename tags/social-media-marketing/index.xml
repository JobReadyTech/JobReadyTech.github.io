      <guid>https://jobready.courseintern.com/social-media-mastery-increase-customer-conversion-rate/</guid>
      <description>What is the final aim of marketing on social media or anywhere at all, yes you guessed it right, the answer is to get actual paying customers or clients. social media marketing, email marketing, and digital marketing, etc are all to make revenues for our brands and businesses and the most common way to do that is sales of products and services.
After successfully helping several businesses and brands market on social media, we discovered that one of the biggest issues faced by businesses is actually getting new clients and customers to trust their business and pay for their products and services which was basically the whole aim of the marketing, this issue was more prominent in medium and small scale businesses especially the new ones, because lets face it, the internet is not really a 100% safe place is it?</description>

      <description>This B2B LinkedIn advertising course builds on my previous one by showing you how to build more scalable full-funnel campaigns, instead of just focusing on the low-hanging fruit when it comes to lead generation. You will learn how to build an efficient lead generation campaign with the appropriate content. Learn from someone who has been doing LinkedIn advertising since 2011, has worked for companies of varying sizes (including the Fortune 100), and has a top-tier marketing MBA from Philip Kotler&#39;s school.</description>
