      <description>&#34;3D animation is a technique which allows for each object or person to have their own three-dimensional space; this can create the illusion of depth while simultaneously creating motion within that world.&#34; Good 3D animation is hard to create or execute and we all know it. What we must further be aware of is what is harder still is being committed to it in the long run as 3D animation is a vast, tiring and long process.</description>

      <description>Hidrolik pistonlar, üzerindeki sıvı basıncını, silindir şeklindeki piston mekanizması sayesinde hareket enerjisine dönüştürebilen, yani uygulanan basınçla mekanik enerji üretebilen sistemlerdir. Hidrolik pompalar tarafından üretilen enerji çeşitli silindirler yardımıyla doğrusal veya açısal harekete dönüşmektedir. Buradaki açığa çıkan kuvvetin büyüklüğünü belirleyen en önemli faktörler, silindirin çapı ve çeşididir.
Hidrolik silindir gövde ve piston olarak iki ana parçadan meydana gelir. Bunların yanında sızdırmazlık elemanları ve bağlantı elemanları silindir üzerinde bulunmaktadır. Çok yüksek basınçlarda kullanıldığı için gömlek et kalınlığı kaldırabileceği basınca göre hesaplanır.</description>
