Introduction
WHY THIS COURSE IS DIFFERENT?	Many of the online courses teach you to code but not the theory/way of thinking behind it why would we choose a while but not a for loop, why should we pass 2 parameters to a function but not only one? This course will teach you how to think about solving coding problems throughout quizzes, there are 112 video format quizzes that aim to keep you engaged with the course and teach you the Python fundamentals in an easy to follow manner</description>

      <description>Are you tired of checking multiple courses on Python and not found even one which meets your actual requirements?

Most beginners study core part of the programming easily but actual programming starts after core programming is finished, since most of real world problems are solved by using programming paradigms such as iteration, recursion, comprehension, object oriented programming etc. 
Most of the preceding topics are heavily influenced by fundamental mathematics, I will try to teach you fundamental mathematics through these programming paradigm such as iteration and recursion through this course.</description>
