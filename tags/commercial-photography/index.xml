      <description>=== Students&#39; Reviews&#39; Regarding This Course ===
&#34;i enjoyed the course, very educative and straight to the point.&#34; -- Muhammad Kabir Musa &#34;This course was simple and easy to listen. There are a few tips I&#39;ve not thought of when looking to earn money with photography. The bonus section was good variety as it showed some tips to editing photos. This is definitely a beginner&#39;s guide and is quite basic.&#34; -- Jessica Lam</description>
