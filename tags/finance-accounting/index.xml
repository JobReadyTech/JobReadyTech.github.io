However, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.</description>

Every smart person has already realized that Bitcoin is clearly superior compared to government money (=USD, EUR, PHP, INR, etc.)
That&#39;s why Bitcoin grows rapidly.
Smart people are trying to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before the rest of the population gets educated about the benefits of Bitcoin.</description>
