This partnership course will focus on the accounting issues that are different in a partnership as compared to other types of entities like a sole proprietorship or corporations. As we focus on the differences, we always want to keep in mind the similarities in accounting for different business entities. Most of what we have learned about the double entry accounting system and day to day accounting transactions in prior courses will remain the same.</description>

      <description>There’s nothing better than passive income. With passive income channels, you’re not limited by how much money you can make because it’s not based on the time you put into it.
Instead, you build your income channel once and it goes on to make you money for years to come.
This course will show you exactly how you can start generating passive income from some of the top hands-free money making opportunities.</description>

      <description>If you’re looking to boost your income, grow a loyal following and position your brand as the go-to source in your market, there is no easier way than by injecting a recurring revenue stream into your business.
With recurring revenue, you can create a strong foundation for your business while taking advantage of the opportunity to incorporate additional income streams into an ever-growing community.
Recurring revenue is consistent and predictable. Unlike other income streams, such as with one-off products or services, with a monthly or yearly recurring revenue platform you know what to expect.</description>

But if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing or if you don&#39;t have a strategy, you end up wasting time and money, in the form of opportunity costs.</description>

      <description>Most people have considered working on a side hustle in order to make more money each month, or perhaps save for retirement.
But unfortunately, many of those same people never took action because they weren&#39;t sure how to work on a side hustle while working on other projects, or perhaps they&#39;re still in a 9-5.
The issue is, there&#39;s a lot of confusion about what a side hustle really means. Many blogs and websites that provide information about side hustles highlight them as though they are a main source of income - and in truth they can turn into that - but that isn&#39;t necessary.</description>

Damals habe ich verzweifelt versucht, endlich eine zuverlässige &#34;Affiliate-Armee&#34; aufzubauen, um dauerhaft mehr Umsatz zu machen.
Allerdings gab es ein Problem, denn Affiliates können sich nie 100%ig sicher sein, ob das Tracking funktioniert.
Das hat auch mich immer mehr frustriert, denn ich konnte ihnen keine klare Antwort geben.
Am schlimmsten wurde es, als ich tatsächlich nachgewiesen habe, dass das Standard-Tracking nicht richtig funktioniert und deswegen die Affiliates abspringen.</description>

      <description>En un principio, el ser humano entendió que por sí solo no podía obtener mejores recursos y bienes, por lo que decidió aliarse a otros, formando aldeas y comunidades, la antesala de lo que fue evolucionando en las sociedades primitivas y la consecuente división de las tareas, dando lugar a los roles definidos dentro de una sociedad. Miles de años de evolución hacen que el mundo moderno estos emprendimientos sean compañías o empresas que pueden alcanzar inclusive gran escala, teniendo algunas de ellas el rol de empresas multinacionales y transnacionales, contando con bienes millonarios y una gran cantidad de recursos bajo su control, pero todo ello gira en torno al sueño o creatividad de una mente brillante.</description>

      <description>Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern wie es war, meine ersten Online Produkte zu verkaufen.
Damals habe ich versucht, mit höherwertigen Kursen und Coachings Geld zu verdienen.
Allerdings hab ich damit gekämpft, ständig Rechnungen zu schreiben und den Überblick zu behalten.
So etwas frustriert und überfordert einen auf Dauer, und mir ging es genauso.
Dann ist etwas ziemlich Blödes passiert: Als ich mich nicht mehr um die Rechnungen (und auch Mahnungen) kümmern wollte, sind die Verkäufe natürlich eingebrochen.</description>
