      <description>A lot of people can decide to quit drinking but maintaining sobriety is another story. If you&#39;ve struggled with the recovery roller coaster of quitting, relapsing, cutting back, and relapsing more times than you remember then you&#39;re not alone. It&#39;s incredibly difficult to stay sober when we don&#39;t have the tools or our mindset is in the dumps after our battle with addiction. This course is here to guide you on your path to recovery so you can build a solid foundation to keep you on your feet.</description>

      <description>Note: this course does not qualify the recipient to perform any form of therapy or counseling for any other person
This is an unusual course as it is designed to be of use/application to men in particular. Of course it is not &#39;exclusive&#39; just a slight bias. Studies are referenced where appropriate.
Please remember that this course includes:
a. the lectures themselves
b. the Q/A section - make full use of it!</description>
