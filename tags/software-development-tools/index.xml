      <description>Microservices architecture provides a modern way of building highly scalable applications. Normally in building cloud-native applications microservices-based architecture is used. In this course, I have explained microservices in the simplest possible way. We start with the explanation of traditional architecture such as Monolithic Architecture, then we discuss how it evolved via service-oriented architecture (SOA) to finally microservices architecture. We talk about the benefits and the challenges of these architectures.
In this course, we do NOT cover the microservices-based-frameworks or advanced level of design patterns of microservices.</description>
