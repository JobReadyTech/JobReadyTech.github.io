      <description>Let’s go back to our childhood and think about primary school for a moment.
I am talking about the time when we were six or seven years old.
The question here is,
What was the first thing they taught us at primary school? First thing they taught us was Writing and Reading, right?
Why it wasn’t Listening and Speaking? Of course, listening and speaking were the core abilities that we were accepted to a primary school.</description>

      <guid>https://jobready.courseintern.com/use-would-in-english/</guid>
      <description>One of the difficulties of English learners is to understand &#39;would&#39; clearly.
Understanding &#39;would&#39; is a challenge and be able to use it in a sentence is another challenge, isn’t it?
No matter how many times I attempted to understand &#39;would&#39; either by looking up the dictionaries or the grammar books, none of them made any difference and I ended up not to understand it. Curious thing is that I came across would quite often and it was literally driving me crazy because I was not able to discover the hidden secret behind it.</description>

      <description>Intonation signals to your audience that you are connecting thought units or ending them. Sometimes we end them with finality, uncertainty, questions, or excitement, for example. Intonation helps listeners follow you with ease. Intonation also gives language a melody and keeps it from sounding boring. This course will teach you proper breathing that works in sync with your intonation. You will also learn how to divide vowels so that the vowels can carry the intonation.</description>
