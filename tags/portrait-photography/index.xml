&#34;This course really helps me to improve my photography knowledge and I would like to thanks all of those who help this to be a success.&#34; -- Wijekoon
&#34;so far the course is about what i really want to learn especially about basic portrait photography. i learn a lot of new things from this course&#34; - Fadila
&#34;Good for an absolute beginner. If you have just bought a DSLR camera and don&#39;t know anything about photography, it&#39;s good way to get your feet wet.</description>
