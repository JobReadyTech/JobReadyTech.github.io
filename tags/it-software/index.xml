      <description>What is sql injection?
A SQL injection is an attack in which the attacker sends a specially crafted SQL query (statement), to a database server and modifies the database as desired. An SQL injection occurs when user input is improperly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
The vulnerability can be exploited by providing input via the user interface, or through hidden fields; however, if user input is used for parameters such as a name or an id, those parameters should be validated as well to make sure that no invalid input is used.</description>

      <description>As a computer science teacher, I noticed that IP addressing was one of the most intimidating topics for my students, and yet, it&#39;s so simple for those who truly get to understand it.
My goal here was to create a course that is as simple as possible, and therefore, easy to understand for everyone, including those who are just beginning their journey into computer networks. One thing I added (that I haven&#39;t seen in the other courses) is summarization - this topic may not be interesting to beginners, but if you plan on getting familiar with advanced routing techniques, you may want to practice summarization.</description>

      <description>What is ethical hacking?
Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.
Also known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture.</description>
