      <description>Public Speaking. Imagine standing up to give a presentation to an important audience knowing that you will look comfortable, confident and relaxed. And you know that your audience will understand you and remember all of your key points. And you did all this even though you procrastinated until the very last hour before you gave the speech.
You can give a great speech that looked like you worked on it for weeks, even though you waited until an hour before you spoke to begin preparing.</description>
