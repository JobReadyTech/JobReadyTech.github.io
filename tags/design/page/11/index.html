          In this course you are going to learn everything you need to know to get started with MySQL in probably less than two hours, so you can actually consume this piece of content in one sitting. The course is surly intensively on using the SQL command line inside the PHPmyadmin tool and that's for teaching you just how SQL works and you can write your queries, not just in the SQL command, but also inside your backend apps and that's the best way to learn SQL in my opinion. ...
