      <description>Creating the graphics is only one part of the job!
There is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that can eat into your design time - and PROFITS - if you don’t have your business model set up to protect you and create a transparent and open designer/client relationship at the same time.
Running a small business always has a fair share of the unexpected. Things happen outside the usual ‘get hired - do the design - get paid’ operations that can slow you down.</description>

      <description>&#34;3D animation is a technique which allows for each object or person to have their own three-dimensional space; this can create the illusion of depth while simultaneously creating motion within that world.&#34; Good 3D animation is hard to create or execute and we all know it. What we must further be aware of is what is harder still is being committed to it in the long run as 3D animation is a vast, tiring and long process.</description>
