      <title>Learn To Focus: Meditation &amp; Mindfulness For ADHD</title>
      <link>https://www.jobready.ml/learn-to-focus-meditation-mindfulness-for-adhd/</link>

      <guid>https://www.jobready.ml/learn-to-focus-meditation-mindfulness-for-adhd/</guid>
      <description>ADD and ADHD can make it hard to focus &amp;amp; get things done. You have lots of mental energy (that&#39;s why you&#39;re so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp;amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you&#39;re working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</description>

      <description>In just 3 years, Visual Studio Code became the number 1 tool any programmer should use. Even if you need a simple code editor, or a complex IDE, with rich features like refactoring, linting or debugger, VSCode is the tool you need. Why use one tool for your HTML and CSS, one for your back-end development and another one for course control, when you can have everything you need in one single, fast and beautiful program: Visual Studio Code.</description>

      <description>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you&#39;re injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</description>

      <description>أهلا بكم في الفيديو التعليمي لرسم رسم شجرة بدون أوراق بألوان الخشب. حرصت في هذا الفيديو أن تبدأ من المستوي صفر وذلك لما يحتويه الفيديو من شقين، الأول هو رسم الشجرة حيث انها من الأشياء الهامة جدا في خيال كل رسام وفنان وثانيا وهي طريقة التعامل مع ألوان الخشب، لاظهار امكانياتها وقدرتها على التعبير بجرأة لرسم الأشجار
كان هدفي بهذه الدورة الاحساس بالمتعة في التعامل مع ألوان الخشب, وذلك بناء علي تكنيك مبسط وسهل, ولهذا قمت برسم للهيكل الأساسي (الساق والاغصان الكبيرة) للشجرة، ثم الأغصان الصغيرة لها, ثم التفاصيل الخاصة الصغيرة حتي تصل الي رسمها باحتراف, مع الأخذ في الاعتبار تأثير الإضاءة على رسم عناصر الشجرة من مناطق مضاءة واخري مظللة, مع ذكر الأخطاء الشائعة اثناء عملية الرسم.</description>

      <description>CLIENT MANAGEMENT IS CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Client management is not an easy position. In fact, any relationship management position is tough.
Namely, because clients are frequently angry or disappointed at your company.
And whose job is it to fix the mess? Yours.
Not to mention that you have to both make the company AND the client satisfied.
All in all, it&#39;s not a very easy position.
What most professionals underestimate, however, is the role of conflict management in client management.</description>

      <description>WHY HEDGE FUNDS?
Hedge funds are one of the most profitable types of alternative assets.
However, they are not easy to comprehend.
Fund structures, investment strategies, provisions and fees, and other elements.
And unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to find a course that covers the essentials of hedge funds.
So it becomes common for a student to:
Not be able to discern among the different investment strategies;
Not know if the provisions negotiated with an investor are helpful to the fund, or not at all;</description>

      <description>This is a course that the Government doesn&#39;t want you to see! Bitcoin is the BEST-PERFORMING asset of the decade.
It&#39;s not a coincidence that Bitcoin has been growing over 200%/year on average!
Every smart person has already realized that Bitcoin is clearly superior compared to government money (=USD, EUR, PHP, INR, etc.)
That&#39;s why Bitcoin grows rapidly.
Smart people are trying to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible before the rest of the population gets educated about the benefits of Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>Apply relevant cost methods to common managerial decisions.
Managers often need to make decisions that are not routine, not part of the normal day to day process, and that can have a long-term effect on the organization. Individuals often need to make similar decisions and can apply similar tools when making decisions of a large dollar amount that can affect multiple years.
Although the specifics of each decision differ, the concept of relevant costs helps us put together a process for gathering and analyzing data, picking up the information that matters, and removing all the excess data that does not matter to our decision.</description>

      <description>Varṇam is a type of composition in the Carnatic music system consisting of short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features (patterns of notes) of a raga.Varnams capture the raga bhavam, ranjaka prayogas visesha sancharas, etc. Dhatu and Janta prayogas (phrase usage) are usually part of a Varnam. Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</description>

      <description>Alışkanlık, otomatikleşecek kadar çok tekrarlanmış davranıştır. Davranışlar duygulara, duygular ise kimliğinize bağlıdır. Altıncı his diye de ifade edebileceğimiz otomatik alışkanlıkları yaparken farketmeyiz bile. İçgüdülerimiz tarafından yönetildiğini düşündüğümüz bu alışkanlıklar aslında beynimizin ve vücudumuzun hiç düşünmediği alışkanlıklardır. İyi alışkanlıkları güçlendirerek, bunun duygu ve düşüncelerinize katkısını görebilirsiniz. Küçük değişimler ile büyük farklar yaratılabilir.
Alışkanlıkların nasıl oluştuğunu öğrenmek değiştirmek ve geliştirmek için önemlidir. 21 günde yapılan alışkanlık olur dense de konu bu kadar basite indirgenemez.</description>

      <description>Ich erinnere mich ungern an die Zeit, als ich kaum Affiliates bei Digistore24 hatte.
Damals habe ich verzweifelt versucht, endlich eine zuverlässige &#34;Affiliate-Armee&#34; aufzubauen, um dauerhaft mehr Umsatz zu machen.
Allerdings gab es ein Problem, denn Affiliates können sich nie 100%ig sicher sein, ob das Tracking funktioniert.
Das hat auch mich immer mehr frustriert, denn ich konnte ihnen keine klare Antwort geben.

Am schlimmsten wurde es, als ich tatsächlich nachgewiesen habe, dass das Standard-Tracking nicht richtig funktioniert und deswegen die Affiliates abspringen.</description>

However, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.</description>

 In questo corso ti spiegherò come poter approcciare, nel migliore dei modi, alla composizione di un’ ottima sequenza dialogica e all’importanza che essa assume all’interno di un racconto, un romanzo o qualsivoglia opera di carattere narrativo. Considera che tra i motivi del “Blocco della pagina bianca&#34; di molti scrittori alle prime armi vi è proprio il senso di inadeguatezza o incapacità nell’affrontare la scrittura dei dialoghi e ti renderai conto che ovviare eliminando gli stessi dialoghi non rappresenta affatto una soluzione effettiva.</description>

      <description>Kamu Yönetimi dersleri, diğer bilim dalları ve derslerden farklı özellikler göstermektedir. Örneğin ülkelerin yapısı ve hiyerarşisine göre değişkenlik göstermesi sebebiyle uygulanış açıklama ve yorumları, evrensel bir dille genel bir yapı göstermediği için diğer dillerden bir uyarlama yapılamayıp, özgün çalışmalar gerektirir.
Bu kurs, bu sebeple daha önce yapılmış çalışmaların ışığında ve öğrencilerin sık karşılaştıkları veya karşılaşmak durumunda olacakları sorulara ve cevaplara çok fazla yer vererek, gerekli anlaşılır açıklamaların yapıldığı derslerden oluşmaktadır.</description>

      <description>Önemli Not : Bu kurs Türkiye&#39;nin ve Udemy&#39;nin ilk Oracle PL/SQL Programlama kursudur. 2011 yılında çekildi ve halen daha bu kadar kapsamlı başka bir Oracle kursu bulunmamaktadır. SQL ve PL/SQL dil özellikleri bilinenin aksine çok hızlı değişmez ve onlarca yıldır sektörde kullanılan bu dillerin özellikleri yok olmaz. Yeni Oracle versiyonlarında genellikle sadece yeni özellikler gelir(kullanıcı arayüzlerine ve dil özelliklerine). Yani bu kurs ilk ama halen günceldir. Bu kurs içerikleriyle hızlı şekilde dil ve genel mantığa hakim olduktan sonra zaman içinde gelen yeni özellikler için ayrıca güncel kitap ya da kurslar(kaliteli TR içerik yok, sadece İngilizce bulabilirsiniz) ile kendinizi daha da geliştirebilirsiniz.</description>

Bu kadar çeşit olmasının nedeni iş ve teknoloji dünyasında veri ile ilgili çözülmesi gereken sorunların çeşitlilik göstermesidir. Klasik veri depolama gibi ihtiyaçları çözmek için, onlarca yıldır Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL vb. gibi gelişmiş VTYS&#39;ler kullanılmaya devam ediliyor. Ancak günümüz teknolojilerinin çok daha karmaşık ihtiyaçlara sahip olması nedeniyle bu veritabanı teknolojileri artık yeterli değildir. Bu nedenle NoSQL kategorisi altında MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra ve daha farklı onlarca alt veritabanı teknolojisi geliştirilmiştir.</description>

      <description>Breakups blow chunks. Whether it’s an amicable breakup or a horrible, crash-and-burn situation, you’ve invested a part of you into another person and must accept that a relationship that you once nurtured is dead and gone. Brain-mapping studies have shown that the same regions of the brain are activated when an addict is going through withdrawals as when someone is going through a breakup.
Whether the relationship lasted three weeks or three years, breakups can leave us feeling heartbroken, lost and even physically ill.</description>

Most of us have been taught a specific traditional method for job interviewing. Once we learn the traditional method, it can be hard to change our approach!</description>

OK, so some interview questions are easier to answer than others. But whilst you can’t predict exactly what you’ll be asked, any question has the potential to make you stumble – unless, of course, you’ve prepared in advance.</description>

      <description>Creating the graphics is only one part of the job!
There is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that can eat into your design time - and PROFITS - if you don’t have your business model set up to protect you and create a transparent and open designer/client relationship at the same time.
Running a small business always has a fair share of the unexpected. Things happen outside the usual ‘get hired - do the design - get paid’ operations that can slow you down.</description>

      <description>What is ethical hacking?
Ethical hacking involves an authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data. Carrying out an ethical hack involves duplicating strategies and actions of malicious attackers. This practice helps to identify security vulnerabilities which can then be resolved before a malicious attacker has the opportunity to exploit them.
Also known as “white hats,” ethical hackers are security experts that perform these assessments. The proactive work they do helps to improve an organization’s security posture.</description>

Most beginners study core part of the programming easily but actual programming starts after core programming is finished, since most of real world problems are solved by using programming paradigms such as iteration, recursion, comprehension, object oriented programming etc. 
Most of the preceding topics are heavily influenced by fundamental mathematics, I will try to teach you fundamental mathematics through these programming paradigm such as iteration and recursion through this course.</description>

Having gone through each lesson once and the hypnosis meditation several times I feel I have already learnt some extremely beneficial strategies..... The sessions are short but very easy to follow, Alan is an extremely good presenter and explains everything well. I will continue to listen to the hypnosis session daily for the next 21 days as he suggests and revisit the rest of the course too.</description>

      <description>Procrastination is one of the principle boundaries obstructing you from getting up, settling on the correct choices, and carrying on with the fantasy life you&#39;ve considered.

Ongoing investigations have shown that individuals regret more the things they haven&#39;t done than the things they have done. Furthermore, sensations of disappointment and blame coming about because of botched freedoms will in general remain with individuals any longer.

Some of the time every one of our chances appear to be on our fingertips, however we can&#39;t contact them.</description>

      <description>Essere un Formatore Teatrale non è semplice, ci si ritrova ogni volta in contesti differenti, con persone di età diverse e che giungono con motivazioni più disparate. Per tali motivi ho cercato di non tralasciare alcun aspetto sul come impostare un Laboratorio Teatrale: dall&#39;organizzazione delle lezioni, alla tempistica, e poi tutti gli esercizi più importanti per fare un laboratorio teatrale, ognuno spiegato nei minimi particolari.
 A dispetto di tanto impegno per fare un laboratorio di teatro, alla fine si hanno grandi soddisfazioni: si assiste lezione dopo lezione alla crescita degli aspiranti attori, li si vede affrontare i vari ostacoli e superarli, ed io stessa dopo ogni laboratorio mi sento arricchita, è qualcosa che solo chi ha sentito il profumo di un palco può capire.</description>

      <description>Cos&#39;è un&#39; improvvisazione? E se si chiama IMPROVVISAZIONE perché studiarla in un corso?
Perché sono state scritte tonnellate di libri a tal riguardo?
L&#39;improvvisazione è una vera e propria Arte e come tale necessita di studio, tecnica ed esperienza. 
Non si può improvvisare senza possedere le conoscenze adatte.
Esistono due differenti forme di improvvisazione, quella &#34;muta&#34; nella quale l&#39;unico strumento comunicativo è rappresentato dal corpo e quella &#34;parlata&#34; durante la quale voce(storytelling) e corpo agiscono all&#39;unisono, quest&#39;ultima è l&#39;improvvisazione di cui ti parlerò in questo corso.</description>

However, I have included some examples of Formula 1 technology, arguably the pinnacle of automotive engineering.</description>

      <description>Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern wie es war, meine ersten Online Produkte zu verkaufen.
Damals habe ich versucht, mit höherwertigen Kursen und Coachings Geld zu verdienen.
Allerdings hab ich damit gekämpft, ständig Rechnungen zu schreiben und den Überblick zu behalten.

So etwas frustriert und überfordert einen auf Dauer, und mir ging es genauso.
Dann ist etwas ziemlich Blödes passiert: Als ich mich nicht mehr um die Rechnungen (und auch Mahnungen) kümmern wollte, sind die Verkäufe natürlich eingebrochen.</description>
