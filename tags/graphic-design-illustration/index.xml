      <description>-- Updated 6/28/21, remixed audio on all lessons --
So what is the deal with selling downloads and print-on-demand (AKA Self Publishing)? 
The answers are in this class!
It doesn&#39;t matter how far along you are in your creative arts business, how old you are, how extensive your portfolio is - setting up downloads NOW creates passive future income for years to come.
