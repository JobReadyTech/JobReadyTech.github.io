転職やフリーランス、Webシステム構築で安定した豊かな生活を手にしたいと思ったことはありませんか？
ここ最近では、コロナによるリモートワークの普及で、システム開発をリモートで行う需要が増えており、特にAWSを使ってのシステム開発は今後も増えていきます。コロナが今後落ち着くかもしれませんが、将来的にまた別の原因によって会社でのシステム開発ができなくなるかもしれません。
もし、そうなった場合にAWSでの開発経験があれば、柔軟に対応できますし、転職やフリーランスなどにも有利になります。この講座で、AWSでのシステム開発を実際に行うことで、AWSでのシステム開発の仕組みを理解することが可能になります。
また、WixでAPI連携を使うことでHTMLとCSSでのコーディングのデザインをする必要がなくなり、画面を直感的に作成できるので、開発時間を大幅に短縮できます。これは個人でシステム開発をしてサービスをリリースする方にとって大きなメリットになると思います。自分でWebシステムを構築してサービスを提供してすることで、さらに安定した生活を手にできます。是非ともWixとAWSでのAPIシステム開発を覚えることで将来に備えていただければと思います。
また本講座はAWSを覚えてリモートワークしたい人の就活・転職用ポートフォリオ作品の超速作成術としてもご活用できますので、是非ご活用いただければと思います。
それでは、このコースの中でお会いしましょう。

      <description>Önemli Not : Bu kurs Türkiye&#39;nin ve Udemy&#39;nin ilk Oracle PL/SQL Programlama kursudur. 2011 yılında çekildi ve halen daha bu kadar kapsamlı başka bir Oracle kursu bulunmamaktadır. SQL ve PL/SQL dil özellikleri bilinenin aksine çok hızlı değişmez ve onlarca yıldır sektörde kullanılan bu dillerin özellikleri yok olmaz. Yeni Oracle versiyonlarında genellikle sadece yeni özellikler gelir(kullanıcı arayüzlerine ve dil özelliklerine). Yani bu kurs ilk ama halen günceldir. Bu kurs içerikleriyle hızlı şekilde dil ve genel mantığa hakim olduktan sonra zaman içinde gelen yeni özellikler için ayrıca güncel kitap ya da kurslar(kaliteli TR içerik yok, sadece İngilizce bulabilirsiniz) ile kendinizi daha da geliştirebilirsiniz.</description>

      <description>Veritabanı teknolojileri, sektörel olarak farklı birçok sorunu çözmek için hazırlanmış birçok farklı marka ve girişime sahiptir. Bu kadar çeşit olmasının nedeni iş ve teknoloji dünyasında veri ile ilgili çözülmesi gereken sorunların çeşitlilik göstermesidir. Klasik veri depolama gibi ihtiyaçları çözmek için, onlarca yıldır Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL vb. gibi gelişmiş VTYS&#39;ler kullanılmaya devam ediliyor. Ancak günümüz teknolojilerinin çok daha karmaşık ihtiyaçlara sahip olması nedeniyle bu veritabanı teknolojileri artık yeterli değildir. Bu nedenle NoSQL kategorisi altında MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra ve daha farklı onlarca alt veritabanı teknolojisi geliştirilmiştir.</description>

      <description>Are you tired of checking multiple courses on Python and not found even one which meets your actual requirements?
Most beginners study core part of the programming easily but actual programming starts after core programming is finished, since most of real world problems are solved by using programming paradigms such as iteration, recursion, comprehension, object oriented programming etc. Most of the preceding topics are heavily influenced by fundamental mathematics, I will try to teach you fundamental mathematics through these programming paradigm such as iteration and recursion through this course.</description>
