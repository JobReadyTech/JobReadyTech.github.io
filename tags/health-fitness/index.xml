Student Review
Having gone through each lesson once and the hypnosis meditation several times I feel I have already learnt some extremely beneficial strategies..... The sessions are short but very easy to follow, Alan is an extremely good presenter and explains everything well. I will continue to listen to the hypnosis session daily for the next 21 days as he suggests and revisit the rest of the course too.</description>

      <description>Meditation is one of the most powerful things that you can do, as a human being. It trains you to be in control of you mind and your emotions, in ways that you never knew were possible. It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you&#39;re injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</description>
