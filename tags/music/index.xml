      <description>Varṇam is a type of composition in the Carnatic music system consisting of short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features (patterns of notes) of a raga.Varnams capture the raga bhavam, ranjaka prayogas visesha sancharas, etc. Dhatu and Janta prayogas (phrase usage) are usually part of a Varnam. Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</description>

      <description>Background sounds such as fans, people talking, cars or trucks moving by, the buzz from defective audio wiring or other ambient noises that shouldn&#39;t be in your movie are all examples of audio noise. Your viewers and listeners will be distracted from the crucial information provided by the individual speaking in your video - if the audio is too loud too. When it comes to crafting a decent video, solid audio goes a long way.</description>

      <description>Welcome to your Music Theory for Guitarists Course!
Hi there! I&#39;m Jack, and I have been teaching music for many many years, and in all of that time, the main thing I have noticed that holds students back, whether they have played for months or for decades, is a lack of an understanding of the basics of music theory. So I&amp;nbsp;have created this course to address that issue so that students will have their fundamentals down and will therefore be able to continually improve without limit.</description>

      <description>Now that we have worked our way through the basics of diatonic theory in our last course, that is to say, understanding major and minor scales and their harmonies, we’re ready to look at some styles that have strayed away from that system.
The most important influence on all the styles of popular music that break away from traditional European music, is Blues music- it doesn’t have to be your favorite thing to play or listen to, but whether you know it or not, there’s hardly a popular style in existence that doesn’t draw from it in some way or another.</description>

      <description>Welcome to your course on Mastering the Modes! This can be a difficult and confusing topic, but not to worry! By the time you&#39;re through, you will the have the modes totally mastered!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
Before you get going, it is best if you have already gone through my course on Basic Theory for Guitar, as that gives you the foundation to tackle the modes, but if you have a strong grasp of all the Major and Minor scales and all their associated chords, you should be good to go, and if not, no worries, my previous course is super fun as well!</description>
