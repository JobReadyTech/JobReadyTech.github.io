      <description>Purandara Dasa (born Srinivasa Nayaka; c. 1484 – c. 1565) was a Haridasa philosopher and a follower of Madhwacharya &#39;s Dwaitha philosophy -saint from present-day Karnataka, India. He was a composer, singer and one of the chief founding-proponents of Carnatic music (Karnataka classical music). In honor of his significant contributions to Carnatic music, he is widely referred to as the Pitamaha (lit. &#34;father&#34; or &#34;grandfather&#34;) of Carnatic music.
Purandara Dasa was a wealthy merchant of gold, silver and other miscellaneous jewellery from Karnataka, who gave away all his material riches to become a Haridasa (literally meaning a servant of Lord Hari or Lord Krishna), a devotional singer who made the difficult Sanskrit tenets of Bhagavata Purana available to everyone in simple and melodious songs.</description>

      <description>Walking down the crowded streets of Thanjavur today, one can still find a measure of peace at the Bangaru Kamakshi temple, home to Goddess Kamakshi. Along with being a place of worship to the throngs of devotees and visitors, the Kamakshi temple is also home to one of the Trinities of Carnatic Music (Sangita Trimurti) - the musical genius and composer Shyama Shastri.
Born to Visvanatha Iyer and Vengalakshmi in a Tamil Brahmin family at Tiruvarur on April 26, 1762, Venkata Subrahmanya popularly known as Shyama Shastri was the eldest of the three jewels of Carnatic music - the distinguished trio of composer-musicians of Carnatic music including Tyagaraja, Muthuswami Dikshitar, and Shyama Shastri himself.</description>

Now that’s an extremely big claim I know. And you might even be asking yourself ‘how on earth is something like that even possible?’.
And the truth is - it’s more than possible!

Hi there! I&#39;m Jack, and I have been teaching music for many many years, and in all of that time, the main thing I have noticed that holds students back, whether they have played for months or for decades, is a lack of an understanding of the basics of music theory. So I&amp;nbsp;have created this course to address that issue so that students will have their fundamentals down and will therefore be able to continually improve without limit.</description>

      <description>Now that we have worked our way through the basics of diatonic theory in our last course, that is to say, understanding major and minor scales and their harmonies, we’re ready to look at some styles that have strayed away from that system.
The most important influence on all the styles of popular music that break away from traditional European music, is Blues music- it doesn’t have to be your favorite thing to play or listen to, but whether you know it or not, there’s hardly a popular style in existence that doesn’t draw from it in some way or another.</description>

      <description>Varṇam is a type of composition in the Carnatic music system consisting of short metric pieces which encapsulate the main features (patterns of notes) of a raga.Varnams capture the raga bhavam, ranjaka prayogas visesha sancharas, etc. Dhatu and Janta prayogas (phrase usage) are usually part of a Varnam. Understanding of these aspects is key to developing manodharma sangeetham (ie., improvisation aspects of Carnatic music such as raga aalapana, swara kalpana, neraval etc)</description>

      <description>Welcome to your course on Mastering the Modes! This can be a difficult and confusing topic, but not to worry! By the time you&#39;re through, you will the have the modes totally mastered!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
Before you get going, it is best if you have already gone through my course on Basic Theory for Guitar, as that gives you the foundation to tackle the modes, but if you have a strong grasp of all the Major and Minor scales and all their associated chords, you should be good to go, and if not, no worries, my previous course is super fun as well!</description>
