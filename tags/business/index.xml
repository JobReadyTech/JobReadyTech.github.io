      <description>The biggest problem with Facebook in recent years is that their organic reach—the people you can reach without spending money—has declined to nearly zero.
Most people are fans of dozens, if not hundreds of pages on Facebook. If all those pages shared several articles per day, most of the posts would just get lost, anyway. There’s just too much content being posted.
So, Facebook has implemented some changes that make it so that only a small fraction of a page’s users ever see each post.</description>

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5 Star rating- July 2018
Yes, it&#39;s excellent… Very good overview of - and training in - the DIRECT SELLING industry.
Having been in this industry for over 32 years (part time, in addition to my Business &amp;amp; Financial Consulting practice) - and having had the privilege of serving on the Board Of Directors of the industry&#39;s professional association for 4 years, representing Canada (ANMP[dot]com - the Association of Network Marketing Professionals) - I see this eCourse from IDSEI, and the accompanying CNM designation, as an important step - both in preparing Affiliates for their business success - and in raising the bar within the industry.</description>

Yet customer service is critical and studies have proven that service is more effective at enhancing volume and profit than marketing, promotion, advertising, research and development, product innovation, capital improvements or any other strategy.</description>

In This course I don&#39;t just show you the way but i built a new dropshipping business while you can see all the process how I picked the product, build the site, market it to start making over 1400$ a day with 400$ net profit, all of this is in under 14 days time frame, if you don&#39;t scale this result and you just keep the same income that&#39;s half a million dollar a year business with over 100k net profit, But the potential of this business is to make a way more money and I think that&#39;s more than enough amount to make you leave your 9 to 5 because I live in the most expansive state in USA and that&#39;s more than enough to have a comfortable living.</description>

      <description>This is a superior way to write non-fiction books.
My name is Ian Stables, author of more than fifty Kindle books. Since I discovered this method, writing books has been so much easier and quicker.
In fact, you can do more than just write books with this process. You can use it to write anything, articles, essays, Kindle book descriptions, Udemy course descriptions, blog posts, emails, and even business reports. It&#39;s that versatile.</description>

      <description>Most people have considered working on a side hustle in order to make more money each month, or perhaps save for retirement.
But unfortunately, many of those same people never took action because they weren&#39;t sure how to work on a side hustle while working on other projects, or perhaps they&#39;re still in a 9-5.
The issue is, there&#39;s a lot of confusion about what a side hustle really means. Many blogs and websites that provide information about side hustles highlight them as though they are a main source of income - and in truth they can turn into that - but that isn&#39;t necessary.</description>

      <description>CLIENT MANAGEMENT IS CONFLICT MANAGEMENT
Client management is not an easy position. In fact, any relationship management position is tough.
Namely, because clients are frequently angry or disappointed at your company.
And whose job is it to fix the mess? Yours.
Not to mention that you have to both make the company AND the client satisfied.
All in all, it&#39;s not a very easy position.
What most professionals underestimate, however, is the role of conflict management in client management.</description>

      <description>Ich erinnere mich ungern an die Zeit, als ich kaum Affiliates bei Digistore24 hatte.
Damals habe ich verzweifelt versucht, endlich eine zuverlässige &#34;Affiliate-Armee&#34; aufzubauen, um dauerhaft mehr Umsatz zu machen.
Allerdings gab es ein Problem, denn Affiliates können sich nie 100%ig sicher sein, ob das Tracking funktioniert.
Das hat auch mich immer mehr frustriert, denn ich konnte ihnen keine klare Antwort geben.
Am schlimmsten wurde es, als ich tatsächlich nachgewiesen habe, dass das Standard-Tracking nicht richtig funktioniert und deswegen die Affiliates abspringen.</description>

      <description>Ich kann mich noch gut daran erinnern wie es war, meine ersten Online Produkte zu verkaufen.
Damals habe ich versucht, mit höherwertigen Kursen und Coachings Geld zu verdienen.
Allerdings hab ich damit gekämpft, ständig Rechnungen zu schreiben und den Überblick zu behalten.
So etwas frustriert und überfordert einen auf Dauer, und mir ging es genauso.
Dann ist etwas ziemlich Blödes passiert: Als ich mich nicht mehr um die Rechnungen (und auch Mahnungen) kümmern wollte, sind die Verkäufe natürlich eingebrochen.</description>

      <description>Las ciencias administrativas han desarrollado importantes investigaciones sobre los individuos y grupos en las organizaciones, que quizás pareciera un tema nuevo. Por tanto, al referirse al Talento Humano se hace mención a ese recurso importante desde una concepción más actualizada considerando los cambios y avances en la sociedad del siglo XXI, con matices más específicos dentro de una organización social. Como resultado, se han presentado diversas posiciones y conceptos, en relación a ese individuo con características muy concretas y complejas que interactúa en una organización bien sea pública, privada, pequeña mediana o gran empresa, pero que algunos gerentes parecieran no valorar.</description>
