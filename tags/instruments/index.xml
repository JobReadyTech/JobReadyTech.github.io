      <description>Welcome to your course on Mastering the Modes! This can be a difficult and confusing topic, but not to worry! By the time you&#39;re through, you will the have the modes totally mastered!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;
Before you get going, it is best if you have already gone through my course on Basic Theory for Guitar, as that gives you the foundation to tackle the modes, but if you have a strong grasp of all the Major and Minor scales and all their associated chords, you should be good to go, and if not, no worries, my previous course is super fun as well!</description>
