      <title>Advanced Psychology for Stress and Leadership</title>

      <guid>https://jobready.courseintern.com/advanced-psychology-for-stress-and-leadership/</guid>
      <description>This isn&#39;t a managing program, it&#39;s psychology. It&#39;s about YOU. Your thoughts, blocks, obstacles, stressors, and how they affect you and the people you care for. Within every craft there is always a mental side of performance, and leadership is not different.
There are many ways stress can be viewed in our normal day-to-day struggle, but I’ll do my best to try not to treat it like a superficial topic, and while I wrote this with the intention of it being clear and practical, this is not a how-to guide or a tutorial on deep breathing.</description>
