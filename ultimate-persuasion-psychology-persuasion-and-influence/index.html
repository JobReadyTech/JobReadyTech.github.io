        <html><body><p><strong>LIKE ALL OTHER COURSES. UNLIKE ANY OTHER COURSE</strong></p><p>Learn <strong>56 state-of-the-art elite persuasion and influence techniques</strong> from my <strong>5 years of influence and performance coaching for top executives</strong> in all different types of sales situations. I'm a 2x MIT-backed entrepreneur turned persuasion psychology/negotiation skills coach who has worked with (and made better negotiators of) different profiles, and this course is for you if you're seeking to improve your influencing, for professional selling or just know more about how to win friends and influence people.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>WHO THIS COURSE IS FOR</strong></p><ul><li><p>Top CEOs trying to close enterprise sales;</p></li><li><p>Top executives trying to "sell" initiatives to executives and board members;</p></li><li><p>Top real estate agents trying to close buyers of million-dollar properties;</p></li><li><p>Politicians trying to sell initiatives as consensus;</p></li><li><p>Billion-dollar AuM hedge fund managers trying to raise capital from allocators;</p></li><li><p>All other sorts of persuasion and influence situations (e.g. a husband trying to "sell" his dream vacation to his wife!);</p></li></ul><p>Throughout my experience in persuasion psychology/influencing/negotiation skills coaching and training, I've <strong>compiled a framework with my most elite persuasion skills and influence techniques</strong> to use for sales, and I'll share all of them with you on this course. Besides just pure persuasion and influence techniques, there are <strong>multiple bonuses included</strong> to help consolidate these influence lessons.</p><p>These techniques use <strong>similar psychological principles</strong> leveraged by persuasion scientists and master salesmen. You will see many techniques similar to Robert Cialdini's, Chris Voss's and/or Grant Cardone's, for example, but these will be the <strong>deeper, more general psychological persuasion elements</strong> (don't be scared by the "general" - we will apply them and explore very specific applications of these). Field-tested and proven in the most extreme situations.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>LET ME TELL YOU... EVERYTHING</strong></p><p>Some people - including me - love to know what they're getting in a package.</p><p>And by this, I mean, <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> that is in the package.</p><p>So, here is a list of <strong>everything that this course covers</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>How making something seem more exclusive makes it more persuasive, limiting access to it or creating more scarcity;</p></li><li><p>How limited access and scarcity work, by making people fight for something due to not having enough time or openings, by pressuring them into making a decision, or by seeming to be associated with exclusive or elite people or entities;</p></li><li><p>How the psychological effect of "removing licenses" work, by cutting of someone's exit before they even think about it;</p></li><li><p>How artificial scarcity can be created by using "rolling limitations" - periods of scarcity combined with periods of non-scarcity;</p></li><li><p>How specialization makes something seem more targeted and "just for you", even if the thing is, in fact, generic;</p></li><li><p>How reducing the number of tasks that you do and the people you do them for (using, for example, the 80/20 rule) can help you become more specialized;</p></li><li><p>How the "advanced effect" works - people always prefer the "advanced" material, even if they are newbies;</p></li><li><p>How secrecy works, by having non-public or confidential steps to a formula - or its variations of mystique - having an aura of secrecy around yourself, and not your work - or vanguard knowledge, being the first person to reveal something;</p></li><li><p>How the technique of "the diagnostic" works, obtaining information and seeming an authority while maintaining a "trusted advisor" frame;</p></li><li><p>How non-attachment works, by signaling abundance, and the extreme technique of "costly signaling" - hurting yourself on purpose just to show that you can do it);</p></li><li><p>How adverse transparency works - being honest even about things that go against you, which makes you more of an authority, and specific variations (small flaws,  other opportunities, or  the opportunity cost of going with you);</p></li><li><p>Advanced applications of adverse transparency, including being more self-demanding, blaming yourself for mistakes you make, or unsatisfactory backtracking (going back to correct something incorrect you said in the past);</p></li><li><p>How displayed authority works - by having an object or another person sing your praises instead of you yourself, you make it seem less biased;</p></li><li><p>The different forms of displayed authority, including introductions by other people, objects such as trophies/diplomas, associations with people or institutions of high value, your image itself, and your behavior in terms of status;</p></li><li><p>The manipulative tactic of "weaving" - picking a group of experts, for example for an interview series, and then inserting your opinion together with theirs to try and seem like you are in the same league or group;</p></li><li><p>The concept of "theaters", including security theaters - situations where nothing may be actually done, but the appearance of something is everything;</p></li><li><p>How naming and labeling fallacies work - attributing specific labels to reduce a person or thing to that label, and how the presence or absence of a name has an effect in terms of personalizing or depersonalizing someone or something;</p></li><li><p>(30 technique descriptions ommitted due to Udemy text length constraints);</p></li><li><p>How to use streamlining to make something seem less effortful, by using words (such as "simple", "quick", "fast", "just 2 steps", "instant access"), by bringing structure ("It's 3 easy steps") or by preempting issues and removing them ("If you don't know how to pay, visit ABC page");</p></li><li><p>How the principle of implementation intention forces a person to visualize how to do something, which makes them more likely to do it because it's less mental effort;</p></li><li><p>How to illustrate progress and loss to change the mental effort of something (both illustrating all the progress done so far, triggering sunk cost biases, or illustrating loss to trigger loss aversion);</p></li><li><p>How removing exits works, by removing the person's licenses to do something;</p></li><li><p>How to use framing to change the apparent value of something (is a barebones application a "basic" one, or one where you can "focus" and "do a few things very well"?);</p></li><li><p>How to use context to change the relative value of something (Something that's $1000 seems expensive. But if it's $2000 at 50% discount, it's suddenly very valuable);</p></li><li><p>The role of perceptual contrast in making something seem valuable;</p></li><li><p>How to use extreme anchoring to strengthen your framing (Instead of mentioning a $10k price, mentioning a $30k price that is lowered to $10k just for the person. The price is the same, but they will value it much more);</p></li><li><p>How changing the option set changes the value of something (Compare a $20 book to $10 books - expensive. Compare it to technical manuals worth $70 - very cheap);</p></li><li><p>How the middle option effect works - people usually pick the middle option in a group - so the options can be manipulated to guide the person, using "decoy options";</p></li><li><p>How to change the option set to strengthen your positioning in terms of the best/the first/the only (You may be "one of the best" workers in your department, but you may be "the best" 40-year-old-plus worker in your department);</p></li><li><p>The role of salience in something's value - the more it stands out, the more people remember it. Using bold propositions, bold names, supranatural stimuli or the bizzareness effect;</p></li><li><p>How salience works in presentations through the peak-end effect (people remember the highlight and the end) or the recency-primacy effect (people remember the beginning and end);</p></li><li><p>The role of intent labeling in closing (forcing a person to state what they are going to do, either actively, or by using active choice - "I will do this" instead of just replying "Yes");</p></li><li><p>The effect of future lock-in, which results from time discounting bias. Giving a person a small advantage in the present in return for them being locked for the future;</p></li><li><p>How justifications make something more persuasive - ideally, tailored justifications, but how even simple justifications - "I need this just because" always persuade more;</p></li><li><p>Considerations in persuading both emotional and logical people (focusing on improving the "basket" of things offered, regardless of their value, versus improving logical elements of the offer such as the price);</p></li><li><p>How eliciting multiple reasons or examples work, by making someone like something more or less;</p></li></ul></body></html>
