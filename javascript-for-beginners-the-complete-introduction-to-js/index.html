Great course and appreciated the bonus, feel good lecture. Instructor is easy to listen to and very good at what he does. Thank you for offering your course which has saved me many hundreds of dollars as well as my precious time from having to schedule the allotted time with a therapist. Very comfortable watching as my time allowed and going through these sessions in the privacy of my home. ...  </p>
