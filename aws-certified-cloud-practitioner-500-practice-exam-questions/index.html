Because of our tested and proven approach, most of our students achieve amazing results with an average exam score of over 85%</p><p><strong>TEST REPORT</strong>: Upon completion of the Practice Test you are presented with a report. This allows you to track your progress and highlights the AWS knowledge areas you need to focus on most in your studies</p><p><strong>RESPONSIVE SUPPORT</strong>: Our team of AWS experts comprehensively respond to all of your questions, concerns or feedback</p><p><strong>ACTIVE Q&amp;A DISCUSSION BOARD</strong>: Join the discussion on AWS related topics in our Q&amp;A discussion board where our students share their recent exam experience offering feedback on which topics were covered</p><p><strong>MOBILE ACCESS</strong>: Study on the go and access all practice questions from your mobile phone - anywhere, anytime</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHAT OTHER STUDENTS SAY</strong></p><p>Our AWS Cloud Practitioner practice tests are widely considered to be the best as they prepare you to the point where you will confidently pass your AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam with a great score. But don't take my word for it, check out the <strong>excellent course reviews </strong>from our happy students who passed their AWS exam with an average passing score of over 850!</p><p><em>"The preparation material for the AWS Cloud Practitioner test proved to be extremely effective. I successfully passed the exam and highly recommend Neal's material for anyone planning to take the exam."</em></p><p><em>"Just passed the Cloud Practitioner exam recently and I would have to give a lot of credit to the practice exams here. They were very close to the actual exam in both form and content and gave me the confidence I needed to feel ready to take the exam."</em></p><p><em>"Exceptional - thank you!&nbsp;Invaluable resource for the actual test! I listened to the 6 hours video from AWS learning center. NOT ENOUGH!!! There are several gaps and lots of portions on the test were not covered in the lecture. 15 hours prior to my test I stumbled upon these sample papers- I wish I had started my test prep with these questions instead!!! Just got back from the test and yes I passed- thanks a ton to Neal. If not for Neal- I would have failed my test."</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>HOW TO BEST PREPARE FOR YOUR AWS CERTIFICATION EXAM</strong></p><p><strong>KEY TRAINING ADVICE</strong>: Although the actual AWS exam has a pass mark of 72%, we recommend that you repeatedly retake our AWS practice exams until you consistently score 80% or higher. We encourage you to put in the work and study the training notes in detail! Once you achieve the recommended score in the practice tests - you are ready to sit the exam and achieve a great score!</p><p><strong>CONFORM WITH EXAM BLUEPRINT</strong>: Using our AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner practice exams helps you gain experience with the test question format and how the questions in the real AWS exam are structured. With our practice tests, you will be adequately prepared for the real AWS exam.</p><p><strong>DEEPEN YOUR KNOWLEDGE</strong>: Please note that though we match the AWS exam pattern, our AWS practice exams are NOT brain dumps.

This is your best chance to successfully pass your exam no matter what questions you are presented with in your real exam.</p><p><strong>COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</strong>: AWS Training and AWS Certification is required in most IT job roles today - in fact, Amazon Web Services is the premier provider of cloud computing services.
