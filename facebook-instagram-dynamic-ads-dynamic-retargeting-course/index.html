This Is Your Ultimate Step-by-step Guide To Becoming A Master Of Facebook Remarketing And Dynamic Retargeting.</strong></p><p><em>"This is the best Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads Course for the starter with advanced level for Facebook Ads Mastery."

Kai</em></p><p><em>"One of the greatest courses on Dynamic Facebook Ads in Udemy. I learnt completely new things that I didn't even expect them to exist! Tomas was absolutely enthusiastic about teaching and I will definitely apply catalog building and dynamic ads in my FB advertising strategies! Well done, mate! And thanx a lot for sharing your knowledge!" Sergey</em></p><p><strong>Dearest Student,</strong></p><p>Hi, it's Tomas Moravek here, Internet Efficiency Awarded digital strategist, with my Facebook Dynamic Ads Mastery, the most comprehensive course currently available that teaches how to unlock the power of Facebook Dynamic Ads using Dynamic Retargeting.</p><p><strong>This Course Will Walk You Through Everything You Need To Know To Master Dynamic Ads.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>It includes my insider knowledge, real world case blueprints, worksheets, To Do Lists, and video explainers on Dynamic Ads, retargeting, remarketing, cataloguing, and the Facebook Business Manager, and features in-depth guides to Facebook Pixel Events and a complete blueprint guide to setting up different events with the Facebook Pixel Event Tool.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Advertising Is A Powerfully Effective Way To Boost Your Sales</strong> as it uses smart tech and intuitive AI algorithms to put the right products in front of users who are ready to purchase. Even if they haven’t visited your website or browsed your app before, if they’re opted into ad personalisation you can target them and convert browsers into buyers by matching the right products to the right people.</p><p>This method works so well, as by personalising the pitch you <em>massively</em> increase your chances of making a sale. You then can continue to retarget potential customers by sending personalised ad “reminders” that encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads Can Be Used To Promote The Products And Services Of:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ecommerce websites</strong> – Match the preferences of your browsers and sell more</p></li><li><p><strong>Real estate brokers or listings</strong> – Target people looking to buy or sell property</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel companies</strong> – Match people’s previous travel searches with your relevant ads</p></li><li><p><strong>Automotive brands</strong> – Sell your vehicles faster by laser focusing on interested buyers</p></li><li><p><em>And more!</em> Market anything using this highly targeted form of advertising!!</p></li></ul><p><strong>With My Course, You'll Unleash The Full Power Of Facebook Dynamic Ads So You Can Automatically Display Laser Targeted Products To Your Website Visitors Or App Users Who’ve Previously Expressed An Interest In Your Business.</strong></p><p>You <em>do</em> need a basic grounding in Facebook Business and Facebook Ads before you study with me on this course, so if you don't have that, I'd recommend starting with one of my comprehensive Facebook Marketing courses for total beginners.</p><p>However, if you have the basics in place, and now want to master Facebook Dynamic Ads, this course will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>To get started you’ll need to set up Facebook Pixel on your website, which I’ll guide you through. This is because Dynamic Ads work best when there is a strong feedback loop between your online product catalogue and your ads. Optionally, if you have an app, you can increase installs by showing relevant ads that direct people to download, and for this you’ll need to install the Facebook SDK.</p><p>As Dynamic Ads work on a large scale, you’ll require a Facebook Business Manager account and uploaded product catalogue. I will teach you how to correctly set up your Business Manager account <em>and</em> create and upload your product catalogue, so you can get started with Dynamic Ads right away. If you have a website powered by Shopify, Magento, or BigCommerce, you don’t need to create a catalogue, so you can skip this step.</p><p>It's easy to learn using my method, as I've taken care to lay out everything clearly for you. Using step by step best practice guides, high quality video explainers, worksheets, and To Do Lists, you'll be able to expand your skillset and quickly build your Dynamic Ads knowledge.</p><p>Using real world case blueprints, and a wide variety of high performing Facebook traffic ad samples, covering a <em>multitude</em> of sectors, I’ll lay out in-depth Every successful remarketing and retargeting strategy that’s possible using Facebook Dynamic Ads.</p><p>I’ll also be giving away my powerful in-depth guide to creating custom and lookalike audiences so you can get maximum mileage from your retargeting and remarketing efforts. This is the MOST comprehensive course currently available that covers remarketing, retargeting, custom and lookalike audiences, Dynamic Ads, the Facebook Pixel, Facebook Pixel Events, and the Facebook Pixel Event Helper and includes all my best practice guides, blueprints, case studies, walkthroughs, video explainers, worksheets, To Do Lists and so much more!</p><p>I've invested so much of my time and effort into putting together this course and I’m excited to share it with you. I'm passionate about sharing my Internet Efficiency Awarded Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and internet success strategies, and I hope you choose to enrol as part of my next student intake.

It will save you so much time, boost your sales, and can work as your automated marketing assistant for as long as you want, 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>Dynamic Ads look like other ads that show up on Facebook, Insta, Messenger, and the Audience Network. The crucial difference is they use your Facebook Pixel or SDK to target people who've already shown an interest in your business, by showing them relevant products that they are highly likely to want.</p><p>Dynamic Ads are Easy and Effortless once you've done the ground work of setting everything up, as instead of having to create a new ad for every product you sell, you create an ad template that automatically uses images and details from your data feed, to construct a targeted ad.</p><p><strong>I'll Guide You Through The Complete Process Of Setting Up Facebook Dynamic Ads With Easy Video Explainers And A Complete To-do List (Checklist), That Includes Key Instructions To Set Up Your Xml Feed And Facebook Pixel Events Correctly.</strong></p><p><strong>You'll Learn How To:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Set up and connect payments to your Ad account</p></li><li><p>Create a new Product catalogue</p></li><li><p>Set up your catalogue format feed correctly</p></li><li><p>Set up your catalogue listings correctly</p></li><li><p>Add your products / home listings</p></li><li><p>Upload your feed</p></li><li><p>Set up Facebook Pixel and Facebook Pixel Events correctly</p></li><li><p>Master powerful Traffic ads so you can start enjoying a stream of new revenue</p></li><li><p>Set up Content ID and Content Type to avoid mistakes</p></li><li><p>Activate automatic advanced matching for Facebook Pixel</p></li><li><p>Set up key events for Facebook Pixel</p></li><li><p>Use diagnostics smartly to tweak your Dynamic Ads</p></li><li><p>Create and harness Custom and Lookalike audiences to target efficiently and expand your reach</p></li><li><p>Copy real world success strategies using Dynamic Ads to retarget and remarket</p></li><li><p>Use my Facebook Traffic Ad blueprint success stories to max your chances of success</p></li><li><p>Get more from your Dynamic Ads spend and boost your revenue</p></li><li><p>And so much more… This is a value-packed in-depth and comprehensive course that covers every aspect of Dynamic Retargeting and Remarketing</p></li></ul><p>Enrol on my course and receive HQ On-Demand Video, plus get downloadable learning resources, lifetime updates and my full support, <em>anytime</em> you need my advice, help, or just want to ask a question.</p><p>You can access this course from any device, including your smartphone or laptop, and upon completion you'll earn a certificate of completion.</p><p>With a<strong> full 30 days, </strong>no quibble money back refund guaranteed, there's absolutely no risk and a world of knowledge to gain.</p><p>Understanding how to make Dynamic Ads work for you can be tricky if you don't know how and there are many pitfalls.
